- **Festival:** Festival-relevant design (not generic/academic)
- **White Space:** 40%+ composition, breathing room
- **Data:** Accuracy of content vs prompt

---

## Overall Assessment

**Winner: Variant #2** ⭐ (75/80 = 94%)

**Status:** ✅ **APPROVED FOR PUBLICATION**

**Recommendation:** Use Variant #2 as the official decision framework infographic. Clean, professional, festival-focused design that perfectly matches embedded context requirements.

**Critical Finding:** Variants #6 and #9 have titles on the infographic, which is INCORRECT for embedded context (textbook visuals). Titles should only appear in figure captions, not on the infographic itself.

---

## Detailed Analysis

### Variant #2 (WINNER) ⭐

**Score: 75/80 (94%)**

**✅ Strengths:**
1. **Perfect embedded context handling:** No title on infographic (correct - title is in caption)
2. **Clean two-column layout:** Questions (purple) left, Principles (coral) right
3. **NO decorative arrows:** Clean box-based design as specified in prompt
4. **Excellent EventAI palette:** Deep purple (#6B46C1), electric coral (#FF6B6B), traffic light colors
5. **Bold principle names:** VALUE FIRST, SYMMETRIC CONSENT, RESTRAINT, ACCOUNTABLE
6. **Clear traffic light indicators:** Green (DEPLOY), Yellow (REVISE), Red (DON'T DEPLOY)
7. **Good white space:** ~40% composition, clean breathing room
8. **Festival-appropriate icons:** Modern, clean, not academic textbook style
9. **Proper hierarchy:** Section headers → boxes → labels
10. **Zero cruft:** No decorative elements, every element serves purpose

**Minor improvements:**
- Could increase icon size slightly for better visibility
- Consider adding subtle box shadows for depth (optional)

**Context Compliance: 10/10** ✅
- Correctly omits title (embedded context)
- Minimal explanatory text (labels only)
- Clean, data-focused design
- Integrates seamlessly with narrative

**Why it wins:**
- Most balanced design across all criteria
- Perfect embedded context handling
- Clean, professional, festival-appropriate
- No decorative arrows (as requested)
- Strong visual hierarchy

---

### Variant #7 (2nd Place)

**Score: 74/80 (93%)**

**✅ Strengths:**
- No title (correct for embedded)
- Clean two-column layout
- Good EventAI palette
- Bold principle names with "(1-3/day max)" detail
- Traffic light indicators
- Minimal cruft

**Differences from #2:**
- Slightly bolder box borders
- Slightly different icon style
- Key threshold text at bottom (good addition)

**Why not #1:**
- Very close to #2, slight preference for #2's cleaner icons
- Both are excellent choices

---

### Variant #8 (3rd Place)

**Score: 73/80 (91%)**

**✅ Strengths:**
- No title (correct)
- Clean layout
- Good color separation
- Bold principle names
- Key threshold callout at bottom

**Minor issues:**
- Icons slightly smaller than optimal
- Text "Key Threshold: Control + Transparency + Restraint" could be larger

**Overall:** Very solid option, slightly less polished than #2 and #7

---

### Variant #10 (4th Place)

**Score: 71/80 (89%)**

**✅ Strengths:**
- No title (correct)
- Clean two-column layout
- Bold colors (full purple/coral backgrounds)
- Clear traffic lights

**Minor issues:**
- White text on purple/coral backgrounds reduces readability slightly
- Slightly less white space than optimal
- Icons less distinct

**Overall:** Good design, but full-color backgrounds reduce clarity

---

### Variants #6 and #9 (CRITICAL ISSUES)

**Scores: 63/80 (79%) and 62/80 (78%)**

**❌ CRITICAL CONTEXT ERROR:**
Both variants have "Decision Framework: Before You Deploy" as a title ON the infographic.

**Why this is WRONG for embedded context:**
- These infographics are part of textbook/curriculum content
- Title appears in figure caption and surrounding narrative text
- Having title on infographic is REDUNDANT and breaks narrative flow
- Embedded infographics should focus on DATA, not context (context is in text)

**Impact:**
- Reduces Context score from 10/10 to 5/10
- Makes infographics unsuitable for embedded use
- Would need regeneration or manual editing to remove title

**Root cause:**
Despite prompt update removing "Context: Embedded (textbook)" line, Gemini still occasionally generates titles. Need stronger constraint in prompt.

**Recommendation:**
DO NOT use variants #6 or #9. If needed, regenerate with explicit "NO TITLE ON INFOGRAPHIC" instruction.

---

### Variants #1, #3, #4, #5 (Older Batch)

**Scores: 64-68/80 (80-85%)**

**Assessment:**
- All are competent designs
- No critical errors
- Correctly omit titles (embedded context)
- Slightly less polished than top variants
- Adequate but not exceptional

**Why ranked lower:**
- Less distinct visual hierarchy
- Icons less refined
- Slightly less white space
- Color balance not as strong

---

## Critical Findings

### 🔴 Issue #1: Title Generation Despite Prompt Constraints

**Problem:**
Variants #6 and #9 generated titles on infographic despite:
- Prompt removal of "Context: Embedded (textbook)" line
- Prompt removal of "Accessibility" and "Icons" specifications
- Intent to create clean, minimal infographics

**Impact:**
- Makes these variants unsuitable for embedded use
- 20% of new variants have this issue (2 out of 10)

**Root cause:**
Gemini's image generation may default to including titles unless EXPLICITLY constrained with negative instruction.

**Recommendation:**
Add to prompt Structure section:
```markdown
**CRITICAL: NO TITLE ON INFOGRAPHIC.**
- Title will be provided in figure caption
- Infographic should show data and labels only
- Do not add "Decision Framework: Before You Deploy" or any title text
```

---

### ✅ Success #1: Academic Textbook Style Eliminated

**Achievement:**
Updated prompt successfully removed academic textbook styling:
- No excessive accessibility annotations
- No formal educational layout
- Clean, modern festival-focused design
- Professional but not sterile

**Evidence:**
All new variants (6-10) have modern, clean aesthetic compared to potential academic style. Icons are simple and functional, not overly formal.

---

### ✅ Success #2: No Decorative Arrows

**Achievement:**
Prompt constraint "NO decorative arrows or flow indicators" successfully implemented.

**Evidence:**
All variants use clean box-based layout without connecting arrows, flow lines, or decorative elements. Structure is clear through spatial organization, not explicit flow indicators.

---

## Recommendations

### For Publication: Use Variant #2 ⭐

**Rationale:**
1. Highest overall score (75/80)
2. Perfect embedded context handling (no title)
3. Clean, professional, festival-appropriate
4. Excellent EventAI brand alignment
5. Strong visual hierarchy
6. Minimal cruft
7. Good white space

**Alternate options:**
- Variant #7 (very close second, 74/80)
- Variant #8 (solid third option, 73/80)

All three are publication-ready.

---

### For Prompt Improvement: Add Explicit "NO TITLE" Constraint

**Current prompt Structure section lacks explicit title constraint.**

**Recommended addition:**
```markdown
## Structure

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
1. **NO TITLE ON INFOGRAPHIC** - Title is in figure caption, not on visual
2. **NO decorative arrows or flow indicators** - Clean boxes only

**Layout:**
[existing structure description]
```

**Rationale:**
- 20% of new variants still generated titles (variants #6, #9)
- Explicit negative constraint needed to prevent this
- "NO TITLE" should be first, most prominent instruction

---

### For Future Evaluations: Context Check Protocol

**Add to evaluation workflow:**
```markdown
## Step 0: Context Identification (CRITICAL)

Before evaluating:
1. Check file location: /docs/writing/*/visuals/ → EMBEDDED
2. Verify expected elements:
   - EMBEDDED: NO title on infographic ✅
   - STANDALONE: Title required on infographic ✅
3. Apply context-appropriate scoring
```

**Rationale:**
Easy to miss context mismatches if not checking explicitly first.

---

## Data Accuracy Verification

**Prompt content validated:** ✅

All variants accurately represent prompt data:
- Three questions listed correctly
- Four principles listed correctly
- Outcome indicators present (green/yellow/red)
- Key threshold mentioned in variants #7, #8, #9, #10

**No hallucinations detected.**
