# STOP - Read These Constraints First

🚨 **CRITICAL**: This is a CONCISE tier infographic. If you create a data flow diagram, you FAILED.

## What CONCISE Means (Non-Negotiable Rules)

❌ **DO NOT CREATE:**
- Data flow diagrams
- Input/processing/output sections
- Multiple boxes or nodes
- Detailed breakdowns
- Lists of data sources
- Processing layer explanations
- Multiple recommendation types
- Small text (<16pt)
- Titles (this is embedded in textbook)

✅ **YOU MUST CREATE:**
- Simple left→center→right flow (3 elements ONLY)
- ONE large impact statistic
- MINIMUM 45% white space
- MAXIMUM 5 visual elements total

**Center 40% of canvas:**
- Large circle with "AI" text (60pt bold, white on purple #6B46C1 circle)
- Label below circle: "Recommendation engine" (14pt gray)
- NO processing details, NO nodes

**Right 25% of canvas:**
- Icon: Festival card/ticket (simple outline)
- Label below: "Personalized picks" (14pt gray)

**Simple arrows:**
- Left → Center: purple arrow
- Center → Right: purple arrow
- NO labels on arrows, NO complex flow

**Bottom 40% of canvas (hero stat):**
- Large number: **"40-41%"** (120pt bold, coral #FF6B6B)

- Subtext: "driven by AI recommendations" (16pt gray)

**White space:** 45%+ of canvas should be EMPTY

## Final Check Before Submitting

Ask yourself:
1. Did you create input/output sections? → If YES, you failed
2. Did you list data sources? → If YES, you failed
3. Did you show processing details? → If YES, you failed
4. Can someone understand this in 15 seconds? → If NO, you failed
5. Is there massive white space? → If NO, you failed

The ONLY acceptable design:
[icons + label] → [AI circle + label] → [icon + label]
[LARGE 40-41% stat at bottom]
[Lots of white space]

Anything more complex = FAILURE.
