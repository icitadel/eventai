## Overall Assessment

**Winner:** Variant #8 (91% - Excellent)
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED - Ready for publication

**Recommendation:**
Use **Variant #8** for personalization.draft6.md - exceptional festival theming with optimal balance of visual clarity, data flow presentation, and professional polish. All three variants are Enhanced tier (correct density), but V8 edges ahead with most prominent festival crowd atmosphere and clearest visual hierarchy.

## Executive Summary

All three variants successfully deliver Enhanced-tier infographics (35% white space, 30-45s comprehension) with complete festival theming, accurate data presentation (40-41% DICE statistic), and clear data flow visualization. Variant #8 wins with the most vibrant festival atmosphere, optimal white space distribution, and cleanest visual hierarchy.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **V7:** Solid foundation, slight background darkness reduces readability
- **V8:** ⭐ Winner - brightest festival atmosphere, optimal contrast, clearest hierarchy
- **V9:** Clean design, but festival theming less prominent than V8

## Recommendations & Action Items

### For Variant #8 (Winner) - Ready for Publication ✅

**Optional Polish (Not Critical):**

1. **Supporting stats box padding** (Priority: 🟢 Low)
   - Current: Adequate padding
   - Optional: Add 2-4px internal padding for extra breathing room
   - Impact: Minor readability improvement
   - Implementation: Regenerate with explicit padding specification in prompt

2. **Input icon labels size** (Priority: 🟢 Low, screen-only)
   - Current: ~14pt (adequate for screen use)
   - Optional: Increase to 16pt for print readability
   - Impact: Improves print legibility (screen use already excellent)
   - Implementation: Only if print distribution planned

**Status:** ✅ Approved for publication as-is. Optional improvements can be applied in future iterations if print use becomes priority.
