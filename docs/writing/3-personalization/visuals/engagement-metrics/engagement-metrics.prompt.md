## Final Check Before Submitting

Ask yourself:
1. Can someone understand this in 10 seconds? → If NO, you failed
2. Is there white space everywhere? → If NO, you failed
3. Did you add charts/breakdowns? → If YES, you failed
4. Are there more than 5 visual elements? → If YES, you failed

If you passed all checks, submit the simple design.
If you failed any check, DELETE complexity and try again.
