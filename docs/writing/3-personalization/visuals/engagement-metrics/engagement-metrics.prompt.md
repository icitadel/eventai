- No timeline showing days 1-4
- No complex charts or graphs
- Keep text blocks to 1-2 lines max

**Target comprehension time:** 30-45 seconds (vs 15-30s for pure Concise)

## Final Check

1. Does it show festival context (crowd, stage, wristbands)? → Must be YES
2. Is there 35% white space (not too sparse, not cramped)? → Must be YES
3. Do you have 3 stats (86%, 20%, 66-point gap) PLUS supporting details? → Must be YES
4. Can someone understand this in 30-45 seconds? → Must be YES
5. Does it feel vibrant and festival-themed (not corporate)? → Must be YES

If all YES, proceed. If any NO, revise.
