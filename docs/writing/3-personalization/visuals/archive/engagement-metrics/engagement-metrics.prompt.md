## LAYOUT & SPACING

- Left (funnel): 40% width, sky blue section background
- Right (chart): 60% width, white background
- Center (callout): Overlapping both, coral highlighted box
- Bottom (breakdown): Full width below chart, light gray section background
- Section dividers: Subtle light gray lines (1px)
- White space: 30-35% throughout, don't cram

## STYLE

Background: PURE WHITE #FFFFFF (verify with color picker)
Section backgrounds: Light tints (light blue 10%, light coral 10%, light gray 5%)
Typography: Inter bold titles/stats, Source Sans regular details
Icons: Festival-specific (crowds, phones, location pins, notification badges) NOT generic business
Chart styling: Semi-flat, rounded corners 4-6px, 2px chart outlines
Font sizes: Title 36pt, section headers 20pt, stats 24-48pt, labels 12-14pt, details 10-12pt

## ❌ AVOID

Cream/beige backgrounds, generic app UI icons, text <10pt, cramped <25% space, complex nested charts, dark backgrounds, overly decorative elements

## ✅ REFERENCE

Adoption funnel shows clear narrowing. Notification chart shows time-series volume. Callout creates visual emphasis on gap + notification fatigue. Festival context with crowd/phone/location icons. Professional data-visualization style.
