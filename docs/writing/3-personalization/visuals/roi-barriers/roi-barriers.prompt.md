## ❌ AVOID

Cream/beige backgrounds, generic business icons, text <10pt, cramped <25% space, dark backgrounds, missing axis labels, unclear quadrant positioning, all features appear equally important (should use star ratings)

## ✅ REFERENCE

Festival context icons. Professional decision-support style. Shows both high-value opportunities (Q1, Q2) and clear things to avoid (Q3, Q4).
