## KEY STATS
- Total investment: $566,000
- Total benefits: $7.44M (Forrester) or $3.56M (conservative)
- ROI: 13x (1,215%)
- Payback: 8-9 months
- Annual benefit: $2.48M average
- Minimum viable scale: $5M annual labor spend, 1M+ transactions
- Small company break-even: >10 years (NOT VIABLE)

## BREAKDOWN DETAIL
Investment: $280K software + $150K implementation + $86K training + $50K maintenance
Benefits: $1.4M labor optimization + $720K overtime reduction + $1.1M productivity + $340K turnover

## CRITICAL CAVEAT
Only viable at enterprise scale with millions of annual transactions and $5M+ labor budget. Smaller companies don't have data volume for ML, nor can they justify fixed costs.

## MOOD
Professional financial visualization, educational about ROI and scale economics. Honest about the caveat that this only works at enterprise scale (not for small/mid festivals).
