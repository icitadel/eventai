#### 📊 DISCREPANCY: Legion WFM Benefits Figure
**Claim:** "$7.44 million in benefits against $566,000 in costs"

**Search Results:**
- ✅ 13x ROI: Verified
- ✅ $566,000 costs: Verified
- ❌ $7.44M benefits: **DISCREPANCY**

**Actual Figures Found:**
- Forrester TEI study shows $13.35M benefits OR $14.3M benefits (sources vary)
- NOT $7.44M

**Status:** ❌ **Incorrect figure - should be $13.35M or $14.3M**
