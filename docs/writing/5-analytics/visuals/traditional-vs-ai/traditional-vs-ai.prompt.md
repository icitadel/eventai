- Body: Source Sans Pro 14-16pt
- Stats: Inter 48-72pt

**Design:**
- Semi-flat, rounded corners 8-12px, 2-3px outlines, minimal decoration
- Festival/operational context (beer kegs, inventory boxes, weather icons, forecasting calendars) NOT generic business stock

## CONTENT

**Band 1 (Data Sources):**
Historical data vs Real-time + historical + external data | "Data lag: minutes (AI) vs 3-7 days (traditional)"

**Band 2 (Forecasting Timeline):**
4-8 weeks before, static "order 10,000 beers" vs 2 weeks + continuous adjustments | "±20% error (traditional) vs ±5-8% (AI)"

**Band 3 (Operational Adjustments):**
Weekly reviews, locked-in decisions vs Continuous monitoring, real-time adjustments | "Decision speed: Days vs Minutes"

**Band 4 (Business Outcomes):**
14% excess inventory, stockouts, missed upsell vs 1.7% excess, zero stockouts, real-time recommendations | "10-15% margin improvement = $900K per festival"

## KEY STATS
- ±20% error (traditional) vs ±5-8% (AI) forecast accuracy
- 18% reduction in overstock (AI)
- <2% stockout rate (AI) vs 2-5% (traditional)
- 10-15% margin improvement (documented)
- ROI: 6-18x annually
- Payback period: 2-6 weeks

## OPERATIONAL EXAMPLES
- Beer case study: 14% excess (traditional) → 1.7% excess (AI) = $108K savings per event
- Tomorrowland: 18% overstock reduction with AI forecasting
