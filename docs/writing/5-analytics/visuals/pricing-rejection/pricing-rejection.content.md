# Dynamic Pricing: Festival Industry Rejection

## Core Message

Dynamic pricing works spectacularly well at sports venues—Real Madrid achieved 29% revenue growth, Golden State Warriors hit 27% increases. The technology is proven.

But the festival industry has actively rejected it. Not because the AI doesn't work, but because fans, artists, and regulators oppose algorithmic ticket pricing for music events.

This visual shows the rejection story, not the system mechanics.

## The Rejection: Four Key Indicators

### 1. Fan Opposition: 91% Reject Dynamic Pricing

Music Fans' Voice survey shows 91% of UK music fans believe dynamic pricing should be outlawed for concerts and festivals.

This isn't a small sample—it represents massive consumer resistance to algorithmic pricing for live music experiences.

**Stat:** 91% oppose

### 2. Artist Rejection: Zero Requests

DICE CEO Phil Hutcheon (2025): "We've never had an artist approach us for dynamic pricing."

DICE processes 40-41% of ticket sales through AI recommendations—but for discovery, not pricing. Artists don't want to alienate fans with surge pricing.

**Stat:** 0 artist requests (DICE, major ticketing platform)

### 3. Regulatory Risk: Legislative Bans Emerging

Australia is moving toward legislative bans on dynamic pricing for live events.

UK government launched investigations after the Oasis reunion tour controversy sparked public outcry.

The regulatory environment is turning hostile to algorithmic ticket pricing.

**Context:** Legislative action in multiple countries

### 4. Festival Deployments: Zero Verified Cases

Despite proven sports venue success (29% revenue gains), zero festivals have deployed dynamic pricing algorithms as of 2025.

Coachella's tier pricing ($399 → $449 → $499) follows inventory thresholds set by humans, not algorithmic adjustments.

**Stat:** 0 verified festival deployments

## Why the Technology Works but Festivals Reject It

**Sports venues:** Fans expect variable pricing based on opponent, day of week, playoffs
- Season ticket holders accept dynamic pricing culture
- Team loyalty overrides price sensitivity
- Corporate buyers absorb premium costs

**Festival attendees:** Expect fair access to experiences they love
- Price surges feel exploitative, not data-driven
- Fan goodwill is fragile—festivals protect it
- Artists don't want fans locked out by algorithms

Ticketmaster EMEA clarification: "Every price is set by the event organizer. If prices change, it's a human decision."

The technology isn't the problem. The operational context is.

## Statistics for Visual

**Fan Opposition:**
- 91% of UK music fans oppose dynamic pricing
- Massive consumer resistance

**Artist Position:**
- 0 artist requests for dynamic pricing (DICE platform)
- 40-41% of DICE sales use AI for discovery, not pricing

**Regulatory Environment:**
- Australia: Moving toward legislative bans
- UK: Government investigations launched
- Oasis controversy: Public outcry triggered action

**Festival Deployments:**
- Verified algorithmic deployments: 0
- Coachella tiers: Human-set thresholds, not AI
- Industry stance: Protecting fan goodwill

**Sports Success (for contrast):**
- Real Madrid: +29% revenue
- Golden State Warriors: +27% revenue
- Manchester United: +22% ticket sales

## Bottom Line

Sports venue ROI metrics are irrelevant to festival decisions when 91% of fans oppose the practice, zero artists request it, and regulators are moving toward bans.

The deployment gap exists because festivals prioritize fan goodwill over algorithmic revenue optimization.
