# Analytics Evidence Summary - Standard Tier Infographic Prompt

**Tier:** Standard (Balanced Detail)
**Context:** Embedded in narrative (docs/writing/5-analytics/drafts/analytics.draft9.md)
**Comprehension Target:** 30-60 seconds
**White Space Target:** 30% composition

---

## Visual Concept

Create a four-tier evidence hierarchy infographic showing what AI analytics actually work at festivals versus what only succeeds in sports venues or doesn't work at all. Use color-coded zones (green/yellow/orange/red) to show deployment readiness.

**CRITICAL - Embedded Context:** This infographic appears within a textbook narrative. DO NOT include a title on the infographic itself—the figure caption provides the title. Focus on data visualization only.

## Layout Structure

**Four-Tier Vertical or Quadrant Layout:**

### Tier 1: Festival Validated (Green Zone) - "Deploy Now"

**Visual indicator:** Green background or border, checkmark icon

**Crowd Flow Analytics**
- Vendor: Crowd Connected
- Deployments: 50+ festivals annually (Coachella, Roskilde, Reading, Leeds)
- Key metrics: 74% opt-in rate, 7x engagement uplift, 28% attended alternatives
- Icon: Crowd density heatmap or crowd silhouettes

**RFID Systems**
- Example: Tomorrowland
- Scale: 200+ countries logistics coordination
- Functions: Cashless payments, access control, crowd monitoring
- Icon: RFID wristband

### Tier 2: Emerging Festival Use (Yellow Zone) - "Pilot with Caution"

**Visual indicator:** Yellow background or border, caution/experimental icon

**Demand Forecasting (Inventory Only)**
- Examples: Roskilde (food sales patterns), Tomorrowland (capacity expansion)
- Use case: Inventory planning based on weather/attendance patterns
- Icon: Forecast chart or inventory boxes

**Discovery Algorithms (NOT Pricing)**
- Vendor: DICE
- Scale: 50% of sales via AI recommendations, 10M monthly users
- Critical note: "Never had artist approach for dynamic pricing"
- Icon: Ticket with discovery/recommendation symbol

### Tier 3: Sports Success, Zero Festival Deployments (Orange Zone) - "Require Validation"

**Visual indicator:** Orange background or border, warning icon

**Dynamic Pricing**
- Sports success: Real Madrid +29%, Golden State +27%, Manchester United +22%
- Festival status: ZERO deployments
- Risk: 91% UK fan opposition, regulatory bans emerging
- Icon: Ticket with price tag and prohibition/zero symbol

**Staffing Optimization**
- Sports/retail success: Legion 13x ROI, 66% time reduction
- Context: Retail/hospitality, NOT festivals
- Festival status: ZERO deployments
- Icon: Staff schedule calendar with zero/prohibition

**Food Waste Reduction**
- Kitchen success: Winnow 50%, IKEA 50% (£1.4M savings), Kitro 23-51%
- Context: Controlled indoor kitchens, NOT outdoor festivals
- Festival status: ZERO deployments
- Icon: Food waste bin with zero/prohibition

**Crowd Prediction (Physics-Based)**
- Stadium success: NEC 10-min advance warning, 20% error margin
- Festival status: ZERO deployments
- Icon: Crowd with prediction arrows and zero symbol

### Tier 4: Small Festival Gap (Red Zone) - "No Evidence"

**Visual indicator:** Red background or border, alert/stop icon

**Reality for Festivals Under 10,000 Attendees**
- Zero documented AI analytics deployments (any type)
- Enterprise systems require scale (Legion: 1.6B data points weekly)
- Affordable alternatives = basic analytics only (sales reports, demographics)
- Economic model misalignment: Data volume incompatible with small festivals
- Icon: Small festival tent with prohibition/zero symbol

## Key Visual Element: The Critical Question

**Callout box or highlighted quote:**
"Does your stadium ROI work at my outdoor festival with temporary infrastructure, or only at climate-controlled venues with permanent staff?"

---

## Style Requirements (EventAI Brand + Tufte Principles)

### Color Palette (EventAI Standard)
- **Deep Festival Purple (#6B46C1):** Headers, primary elements
- **Electric Coral (#FF6B6B):** Accent highlights, emphasis
- **Sky Blue (#4299E1):** Data visualization, supporting elements
- **Midnight Slate (#2D3748):** Body text, labels
- **Warm Sunlight (#F6AD55):** Secondary accents
- **Pure White (#FFFFFF):** Background, breathing room

**Color-coding for tiers:**
- Green zone: Festival-validated (use blue-green or forest green, not neon)
- Yellow zone: Emerging use (warm sunlight or amber)
- Orange zone: Require validation (electric coral works here)
- Red zone: No evidence (deep red, not bright red)

### Typography (Two-Font Rule)
- **Headers/Labels:** Clean sans-serif (Inter, Helvetica, Proxima Nova equivalent)
- **Body text/Data:** Same sans-serif, smaller weight
- **Maximum:** 2 font families total
- **Readability:** All text legible at print size (300 DPI minimum)

### Layout Principles
- **White space:** 30% of composition (breathing room between tiers)
- **Visual hierarchy:** Tier 1 (top/largest) → Tier 4 (bottom/smallest emphasis)
- **Flow:** Natural reading top-to-bottom or left-to-right
- **Alignment:** Consistent margins, aligned elements

### Tufte Principles (Minimal Cruft)
- **Data-ink ratio:** Every pixel serves information, no decoration
- **No decorative borders:** Use white space for separation, not ornamental lines
- **No unnecessary shadows/gradients:** Flat design, functional color only
- **No generic stock imagery:** Festival-specific icons only
- **Graphical integrity:** Zone sizes reflect importance, not arbitrary aesthetics

### Professional + Whimsy Balance
- **Foundation (80%):** Clean structure, clear tier separation, readable data
- **Personality (20%):** Festival-relevant icons (crowd silhouettes, stages, wristbands, tents), unexpected color pops from EventAI palette
- **Avoid:** Corporate clichés (suits, handshakes, offices), AI stereotypes (robots, circuit brains)

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Contrast ratio:** 4.5:1 minimum (WCAG AA standard)
- **Color independence:** Use icons + text + color (not color alone) for tier distinctions
- **Labels:** All data points clearly labeled, no color-only information
- **Readability:** Text size sufficient for low-vision users

### Festival Context
- **Icons:** Crowd silhouettes, festival stages, tents, RFID wristbands, outdoor venues
- **Metaphors:** Temporary infrastructure vs permanent stadiums, outdoor vs controlled environments
- **Avoid:** Generic business imagery (offices, conference rooms, handshakes, suits)
- **Avoid:** AI clichés (robot overlords, circuit board brains, sci-fi tech)

## Standard Tier Density Requirements

**Text Pattern:** 10-15 words per bullet
- ✅ "Crowd Connected deploys at 50+ festivals annually including Coachella, Roskilde, Reading, and Leeds"
- ❌ "Crowd Connected" (too sparse for Standard)
- ❌ "Crowd Connected is a leading provider of crowd flow analytics solutions that deploy at more than 50 festivals annually across multiple continents including major events like Coachella, Roskilde, Reading, and Leeds festivals, providing real-time heatmaps and location-based notifications" (too dense, becomes Detailed)

**Structural Metrics:**
- **Concepts:** 12-20 distinct data points (4 tiers × 3-5 concepts each)
- **Depth:** 2-3 levels (Tier → Category → Key metric)
- **Complexity score:** 50-100 (balanced detail without overwhelming)

**Visual breakdown:**
- Tier 1: 2 categories (Crowd flow, RFID) × 3-4 metrics each = 6-8 concepts
- Tier 2: 2 categories (Forecasting, Discovery) × 2-3 metrics each = 4-6 concepts
- Tier 3: 4 categories (Pricing, Staffing, Waste, Prediction) × 2 metrics each = 8 concepts
- Tier 4: 1 category (Small festivals) × 3-4 metrics = 3-4 concepts
- **Total:** ~21-26 concepts (appropriate for Standard tier)

**White Space:**
- 30% of composition should be empty (margins, spacing between tiers, breathing room)
- Use white space to separate zones, not decorative lines or borders
- Strategic emptiness = visual power

**Comprehension Time:**
- Reader should grasp the hierarchy in 30-60 seconds
- Quick scan reveals four tiers and color-coding
- Close reading reveals specific vendors and metrics
- Rewards attention with detail, but doesn't require minutes of study

## Example Text Density (Standard Tier)

**✅ Appropriate for Standard:**
- "Crowd Connected deploys at 50+ festivals annually (Coachella, Roskilde, Reading, Leeds)"
- "Legion WFM achieved 13x ROI in retail/hospitality with 66% scheduling time reduction"
- "ZERO festival deployments despite 29% revenue increase at Real Madrid stadium"

**❌ Too sparse (Concise tier):**
- "Crowd Connected: 50+ festivals"
- "Legion: 13x ROI"
- "Zero deployments"

**❌ Too dense (Detailed tier):**
- "Crowd Connected operates at more than 50 festivals annually including Coachella, Roskilde, Reading, Leeds, V Festival, Wireless, Latitude, and Goodwood Festival of Speed, utilizing mobile app SDK combined with WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS to deliver real-time heatmaps with ML-based self-calibration requiring no manual fingerprinting"

## Relation to Analytics Narrative

This infographic appears at the END of analytics.draft9.md as a comprehensive summary of the evidence hierarchy discussed throughout the narrative. It visually reinforces the core thesis:

**Only crowd flow analytics has substantial festival validation. Dynamic pricing, staffing optimization, and food waste reduction have impressive sports venue metrics but zero festival deployments.**

Readers should understand:
1. What's safe to deploy now (Tier 1: Crowd flow, RFID)
2. What's emerging but unproven (Tier 2: Forecasting, discovery)
3. What requires festival validation before trust (Tier 3: Pricing, staffing, waste, prediction)
4. What has no pathway for small festivals (Tier 4: Enterprise scale mismatch)

The infographic serves as a decision-making tool: festival organizers can identify which technologies have evidence supporting their context versus which require skepticism about sports-venue-derived claims.
