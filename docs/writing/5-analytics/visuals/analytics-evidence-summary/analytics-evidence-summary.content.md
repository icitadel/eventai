# AI Analytics Evidence Hierarchy - Summary Data

## Purpose
Summary infographic showing the evidence hierarchy for AI analytics in festivals, distinguishing between festival-validated deployments, emerging uses, sports-venue-only success, and the small festival gap.

## Core Message
Only crowd flow analytics has substantial festival validation. Everything else is either emerging or proven elsewhere but not at festivals.

## Data Structure

### Tier 1: Festival Validated (Deploy Now)

**Crowd Flow Analytics**
- Vendor: Crowd Connected
- Deployments: 50+ festivals annually
- Examples: Coachella, Roskilde, Reading, Leeds, Wireless
- Key Metrics:
  - 74% opt-in rate (Roskilde)
  - 7x engagement uplift (Latitude)
  - 105M tracking points collected
  - 28% attended suggested alternatives

**RFID Systems**
- Example: Tomorrowland
- Scale: 200+ countries logistics coordination
- Functions: Cashless payments, access control, crowd flow monitoring
- Status: Validated at scale

### Tier 2: Emerging Festival Use (Pilot with Caution)

**Demand Forecasting (Inventory Planning)**
- Roskilde: Food sales patterns by weather/temperature
- Tomorrowland: Pre-registration analysis → expansion to 2 weekends
- Status: Limited festival validation, inventory focus

**Discovery Algorithms (NOT Pricing)**
- Vendor: DICE
- Scale: 50% of ticket sales via AI recommendations
- Users: 10M monthly active users
- Important: "Never had artist approach for dynamic pricing"
- Use case: Ticket discovery, not price optimization

### Tier 3: Sports Success, Zero Festival Deployments (Require Validation)

**Dynamic Pricing**
- Real Madrid: +29% matchday revenue
- Golden State Warriors: +27% revenue, 92% prediction accuracy
- Manchester United: +22% ticket sales
- Festival status: ZERO deployments
- Regulatory risk: 91% UK fan opposition, Australian bans emerging

**Staffing Optimization**
- Legion WFM: 13x ROI (Forrester-audited)
- Metrics: 66% scheduling time reduction, 1.6B data points weekly
- Context: Retail/hospitality, NOT festivals
- Festival status: ZERO deployments

**Food Waste Reduction**
- Winnow Solutions: Up to 50% waste reduction
- IKEA: 50% reduction, £1.4M savings (23 stores)
- Kitro: 23-51% reduction (peer-reviewed)
- Context: Controlled indoor kitchens, NOT festivals
- Festival status: ZERO deployments

**Physics-Based Crowd Prediction**
- NEC Corporation: 10-minute advance congestion prediction
- Accuracy: Within 20% margin of error
- Context: Stadiums only
- Festival status: ZERO deployments

### Tier 4: Small Festival Gap (No Evidence)

**Reality for Festivals Under 10,000 Attendees**
- Zero documented AI analytics deployments
- Enterprise systems don't downscale
- Affordable alternatives (FIXR, Eventbrite, ClearEvent) = basic analytics only
- No AI/ML forecasting, resource allocation, or waste reduction
- Economic model misalignment: Data volume requirements incompatible

## Key Statistics for Visual Emphasis

**Festival Validated:**
- 50+ festivals (crowd flow)
- 74% opt-in rate
- 7x engagement boost

**Sports Success (NOT Festivals):**
- 13x ROI (staffing)
- 50% waste reduction (food)
- 29% revenue increase (pricing)

**Evidence Gap:**
- Zero dynamic pricing deployments at festivals
- Zero staffing AI deployments at festivals
- Zero food waste AI deployments at festivals
- Zero small festival AI deployments (any type)

## Critical Question for Visual

**"Does your 78% yield improvement work at my multi-day outdoor festival with temporary infrastructure, or only at climate-controlled stadiums with permanent staff and years of historical data?"**

## Visual Guidance

**Layout Suggestion:**
Four tiers shown vertically or as quadrants:
- Tier 1 (Green zone): "Deploy Now" - Crowd flow, RFID
- Tier 2 (Yellow zone): "Pilot with Caution" - Demand forecasting, discovery
- Tier 3 (Orange zone): "Require Festival Validation" - Pricing, staffing, waste, prediction
- Tier 4 (Red zone): "No Small Festival Path" - Complete evidence void

**Color Coding:**
- Green: Festival-validated
- Yellow: Emerging festival use
- Orange: Sports success, no festival deployments
- Red: No evidence at any festival scale

**Include:**
- Vendor names where relevant
- Key percentage metrics
- "Zero deployments" callouts for Tier 3
- The critical transferability question

**Festival Context:**
- Use festival-relevant icons (crowd silhouettes, stages, tents, wristbands)
- NOT generic business/tech imagery (offices, suits, handshakes, robots)
- Show temporary infrastructure vs permanent stadium contrast
