# Infographic Generation Prompt: Traditional vs AI Analytics Promise

Create a CONCISE split-comparison infographic showing traditional festival analytics vs AI promises across three key dimensions.

## Title

Traditional vs AI-Powered Analytics: The Promise

## Layout Structure

Split vertical design with clear left-right division:

**LEFT SIDE: TRADITIONAL** (muted browns/grays)
- Spreadsheet icon or filing cabinet
- Subdued, dated aesthetic

**RIGHT SIDE: AI PROMISE** (vibrant EventAI colors)
- Modern tech aesthetic
- Electric coral for key stats
- Sky blue for data elements

**VERTICAL DIVIDER:** Deep purple (#6B46C1) bold line separating the two approaches

## Three Comparison Rows

### Row 1: Forecast Accuracy

**Traditional (left)**
±20% error rate
4-8 weeks advance planning

**AI Promise (right)**
±5-8% error rate
Real-time hourly adjustments

**Improvement callout (right side):** 60-75% accuracy gain

### Row 2: Decision Speed

**Traditional (left)**
Days to adjust
Phone calls + spreadsheets

**AI Promise (right)**
Minutes to implement
Automated alerts

**Improvement callout (right side):** 1000x+ faster

### Row 3: Waste Reduction

**Traditional (left)**
14% excess inventory
One-time ordering

**AI Promise (right)**
<2% waste
Dynamic reordering

**Improvement callout (right side):** 85% reduction

## Bottom Callout Bar

The Promise: Sports venues + retail stores deliver these results
The Reality: Zero documented festival deployments (2025)

## Visual Elements

⚠️ CRITICAL FESTIVAL CONTEXT:
- **Illustrated festival crowd visible in background** behind the split comparison
- Draw diverse festival-goers in casual clothing (NOT corporate business attire)
- Show people wearing festival wristbands
- Include festival stage elements or structures
- Make the crowd VISIBLE and ILLUSTRATED (not just subtle silhouettes)

Other elements:
- Spreadsheet/filing icons for Traditional side
- Clean modern icons for AI side (no robots or clichés)
- Electric coral circles for improvement percentages on AI side
- Check marks (green #48BB78) for AI advantages
- Warning icons (amber #ED8936) for Traditional limitations

## EventAI Color Palette

- Deep purple: #6B46C1 (vertical divider, section headers)
- Electric coral: #FF6B6B (improvement stats, key numbers)
- Sky blue: #4299E1 (AI-side data elements)
- Amber: #ED8936 (Traditional-side warning indicators)
- Slate gray: #2D3748 (body text)
- White: #FFFFFF (background)

## Typography

- Title: Inter Bold, 28-32pt
- Row headers (Forecast Accuracy, etc.): Inter Bold, 20-24pt
- Statistics: Inter Bold, 40-48pt for hero numbers
- Body text: Source Sans Pro Regular, 14-16pt
- Bottom callout: Inter Medium, 16pt

## CONCISE Density Requirements

⚠️ CRITICAL WHITE SPACE:
- Target 40%+ white space (not 30%)
- Generous breathing room between rows
- 48-64px margins minimum
- 32-48px spacing between comparison elements

❌ DO NOT ADD:
- Decorative boxes around rows
- Multiple icons per section (1-2 maximum per side)
- Gradient backgrounds
- Chart/graph embellishments
- Any text not specified above

✅ KEEP IT MINIMAL:
- Clean split design
- Three comparison rows
- One improvement stat per row
- Bottom reality check callout
- **Illustrated festival crowd in background (REQUIRED)**

## Target Scan Time

15-30 seconds to grasp all three promises and the deployment gap

## Accessibility

- Text contrast minimum 4.5:1 (WCAG AA)
- Information not conveyed by color alone (use icons + text + color)
- Minimum 14pt body text
- High contrast for readability

## Festival Context Integration

⚠️ REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP:
- **Illustrated festival crowd in background** - diverse people in casual festival clothing
- Festival wristbands visible on attendees
- Festival stage or tent structures
- Make crowd VISIBLE and clearly festival-themed (not faint/subtle)

❌ NEVER INCLUDE:
- Generic business people in suits
- Corporate office settings
- Robot/AI clichés
- Stadium seating (festivals use open fields/tents)
