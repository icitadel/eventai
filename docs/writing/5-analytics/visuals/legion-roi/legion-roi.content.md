## Legion WFM ROI: Forrester TEI Study Analysis

### Overview: What is Legion WFM?

Legion Technologies provides AI-powered workforce management (WFM) software designed for large enterprise event and hospitality companies. The system optimizes staff scheduling, predicts demand, manages labor costs, and reduces overtime through machine learning.

**Key functions:**
- Demand forecasting (predict customer traffic by hour)
- Labor scheduling optimization (assign staff to shifts based on forecasted demand)
- Overtime reduction (avoid costly unplanned overtime)
- Turnover reduction (improve employee experience through predictable scheduling)
- Compliance management (track labor laws, break times, etc.)

### Benefits Realized: 3-Year Revenue Impact

**Study basis**: Same enterprise-scale company, comparing Legion WFM adoption vs. legacy manual scheduling

#### 1. Labor Optimization ($4,200,000 over 3 years)
- **Mechanism**: Legion's demand forecasting matches staffing to actual customer traffic
- **Traditional approach**: Schedule staff based on gut feel or historical averages → often over-staffed during slow hours
- **Legion approach**: Predict hourly demand (e.g., "Friday 6-8 PM = 8,000 orders, need 45 staff") → optimize shifts to match
- **Benefit**: Reduce unnecessary labor hours without compromising service

**Calculation**:
- Enterprise average annual spend on labor (all staff): $8,000,000
- Labor cost per employee per event: $15-25/hour (blended)
- Unnecessary labor waste (traditional overstaffing): 8-12% of total labor spend
- With Legion optimization: Reduce waste to 2-3%
- Annual savings: $8M × (10% - 2.5%) = $600,000/year
- 3-year total: **$1,400,000** (conservative)

**Realistic range (Forrester study)**: $1.2M - $1.6M per enterprise

#### 2. Reduced Overtime Costs ($1,800,000 over 3 years)
- **Mechanism**: Accurate scheduling eliminates unplanned overtime, which costs 1.5x regular labor
- **Traditional problem**:
  - Forecast says "need 40 staff" but actually 55 customers arrive
  - Existing staff called in (overtime premium: 1.5x-2x wages)
  - Or staff work unauthorized overtime (legal liability + high morale cost)
- **Legion solution**:
  - Precise demand forecast → accurate schedules
  - Overtime reduced by 40-60%

**Calculation**:
- Average event overtime hours/year (traditional): 20,000 hours
- Overtime premium: 1.5x wage vs. 1.0x regular
- Overtime labor cost (traditional): 20,000 hrs × $20/hr × 1.5 = $600,000/year
- With Legion (40% reduction): 12,000 hrs × $20/hr × 1.5 = $360,000/year
- Annual savings: $600,000 - $360,000 = $240,000/year
- 3-year total: **$720,000** (conservative)

**Realistic range (Forrester)**: $600K - $900K per enterprise

#### 3. Productivity Improvement ($1,100,000 over 3 years)
- **Mechanism**: Proper scheduling reduces employee stress, absenteeism, turnover
- **Components**:
  - Reduced absenteeism: Predictable schedules → employees show up (save $200K/year)
  - Faster onboarding: Better employee experience → faster ramp to full productivity ($150K/year)
  - Equipment efficiency: With right staffing, equipment utilization increases ($200K/year)
- **Total**: ~$550,000/year average

**3-year total**: **$1,100,000** (conservative)

#### 4. Turnover Reduction ($340,000 over 3 years)
- **Mechanism**: Employees hate unpredictable schedules. Legion makes schedules visible weeks in advance
- **Traditional cost of turnover**:
  - Recruiting cost per hire: $2,000-4,000
  - Training cost per new hire: $5,000
  - Lost productivity (ramp-up time): $3,000
  - Total turnover cost per hire: ~$12,000
- **Traditional turnover rate** (hospitality/events): 50-80% annual
- **With Legion**: Turnover reduction of 15-20% (from better scheduling experience)

**Calculation**:
- Enterprise employee base: 200 core + 500 seasonal = 700 total
- Traditional turnover: 60% × 700 = 420 departures/year
- Replacement hires needed: 420
- Turnover cost: 420 × $12,000 = $5,040,000/year
- With Legion (15% reduction): 357 departures, saves 63 replacements
- Savings: 63 × $12,000 = $756,000/year
- 3-year total: **$2,268,000** (optimistic upper bound)

**Conservative estimate (Forrester)**: $100K-$150K/year = **$300K-450K** over 3 years

**Used estimate**: **$340,000** (middle ground)

### Benefits Summary
- Labor optimization: $1,400,000
- Reduced overtime: $720,000
- Productivity improvement: $1,100,000
- Turnover reduction: $340,000
- **TOTAL BENEFITS (3 YEARS)**: **$3,560,000** (conservative)

**Forrester published estimate**: $7.44 million (including additional benefits like reduced compliance violations, improved customer satisfaction proxies)

**Range**: $3.5M (conservative) to $7.44M (full value with customer satisfaction impact multiplier)

### ROI & Payback Analysis

**Net Benefit** (3 years):
- Total benefits: $7,440,000 (Forrester TEI baseline)
- Total investment: $566,000
- **Net benefit**: $7,440,000 - $566,000 = **$6,874,000**

**ROI Calculation**:
- ROI = (Net Benefit / Investment) × 100
- ROI = ($6,874,000 / $566,000) × 100
- **ROI: 1,215%** or **13x return on investment**

**Payback Period**:
- Annual benefit (average): $7,440,000 / 3 = $2,480,000
- Time to recover investment: $566,000 / $2,480,000 = 0.23 years
- **Payback: ~8-9 months**

**Year-by-year breakdown**:
- **Year 1**: Investment $250K, Benefits $2.0M, Net +$1.75M
- **Year 2**: Investment $200K, Benefits $2.6M, Net +$2.4M
- **Year 3**: Investment $116K, Benefits $2.8M, Net +$2.68M

### Critical Caveat: Enterprise Scale Only

**Legion WFM requires massive scale to break even:**

1. **Minimum enterprise requirements**:
   - Annual transactions: 1M+ (multi-property operations)
   - Employee base: 200+ core staff + seasonal workforce
   - Annual labor spend: $5M+ (needed to see material % improvements)
   - Multi-location operation (single-event companies don't have enough data for ML)

2. **Why it fails at smaller scales**:
   - **Fixed costs don't scale**: $280K software licensing, $150K implementation is same for 100-person company as 700-person company
   - **Smaller company economics**: 100-person company with $1M annual labor → 50% ROI; 700-person company with $7M labor → 1,215% ROI
   - **Data requirements**: Legion ML models require millions of data points to train. Small companies with <100,000 annual events don't have sufficient data

3. **Break-even analysis by company size**:
   - **Micro (1 event/year)**: $566K investment, $50K annual benefit → **-$516K loss**, payback >10 years (NOT VIABLE)
   - **Small (10 events/year, 50 staff)**: $566K investment, $300K annual benefit → 0.9-year payback (barely viable)
   - **Mid-market (50 events/year, 200 staff)**: $566K investment, $1.2M annual benefit → 5.6 month payback (viable)
   - **Enterprise (200+ events/year, 700 staff)**: $566K investment, $2.48M annual benefit → 2.8 month payback (highly viable)

4. **Bottleneck for mid-market/small events**:
   - Can't justify $280K/year licensing on $1M labor budget
   - Better option: Spreadsheet-based scheduling, manual demand forecasting (cost: $50K/year)
   - Gap: $50K software doesn't exist that bridges micro/small to enterprise platforms
