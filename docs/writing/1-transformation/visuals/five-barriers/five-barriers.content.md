## Core Message

AI fails most of the time—not the technology, but the implementation. McKinsey 2025 research shows over 80% of organizations report no significant bottom-line impact from AI investments, despite AI spending skyrocketing from $11.5 billion (2024) to $37 billion (2025). Five barriers explain why the transformation isn't inevitable: Money, Data, Legal, Integration, and Trust.

## The Five Barriers

### 1. The Money Problem

**Challenge:** Enterprise-scale economics don't translate to festivals

**Key Facts:**
- Legion WFM workforce optimization: $566,000 over three years
- Benefits generated: $7.44 million (13x return)
- Catch: You need enterprise scale to hit those numbers
- Small festivals can't afford upfront investment
- Insufficient transaction volume to train accurate models

**Result:** The rich get richer. Regional festivals fall further behind.

**Icon Suggestion:** Dollar sign with barrier/lock, or piggy bank with "X" mark

---

### 2. The Data Problem

**Challenge:** AI needs training data festivals don't have

**Key Facts:**
- First-time deployment: No historical patterns to learn from
- Transfer learning helps but is complicated and delays ROI
- Annual festivals: One training opportunity per year
- Brutal for iterative improvement
- Can't fine-tune models quickly

**Result:** Annual event cycle makes AI optimization painfully slow.

**Icon Suggestion:** Database with question mark, or chart with gaps/missing data

### 3. The Legal Problem

**Challenge:** Regulatory burden is heavy, mistakes are expensive

**Key Facts:**
- EU AI Act fines: €35 million OR 7% global turnover (whichever is higher)
- Real-time biometric identification: BANNED for private organizers
- Post-event biometric analysis: High-risk classification, requires conformity assessments
- GDPR layer: Explicit informed consent required for biometric data
- Need alternative entry methods for opt-outs

**Result:** Existential risk if you deploy non-compliant systems.

**Icon Suggestion:** Gavel/scales of justice, or shield with warning symbol

---

### 4. The Integration Problem

**Challenge:** Festivals are temporary, harsh, multi-vendor environments

**Key Facts:**
- Limited network infrastructure (temporary outdoor sites)
- Distributed power from generators
- Harsh conditions: dust, mud, rain, heat
- Multi-vendor ecosystems: 10+ separate systems need to talk to each other
- Anonymous festival CTO: "WiFi coverage was 60%. AI was blind in 40% of venue. Zero value."

**Result:** Technical debt accumulates fast when bolting AI onto infrastructure that wasn't built for it.

**Icon Suggestion:** Puzzle pieces that don't fit, or broken connection/network symbol

---

### 5. The Trust Problem

**Challenge:** Covert deployment destroys trust, over-optimization kills magic

**Key Facts:**
- 40+ major festivals pledged NO facial recognition after civil rights campaigns (2019)
- Taylor Swift 2018 Rose Bowl incident: 60,000 attendees secretly scanned via facial recognition kiosks
- Generated backlash that kills technology adoption regardless of capability
- Paul Tollett (Coachella founder, 2024): "Part of the festival experience is getting lost, stumbling into a tent you didn't plan to visit, having your mind blown. We have to be careful AI doesn't over-engineer that magic."

**Result:** Over-optimization risks making festivals transactional instead of transformative.

**Icon Suggestion:** Broken handshake, or festival tent with person looking concerned

## Context Statistics

**Overall AI Implementation Failure:**
- **80%+** organizations report no significant bottom-line impact (McKinsey 2025)
- **6%** achieve "high performer" status (5%+ EBIT impact)
- **1%** consider their deployment "mature"
- **AI investment:** $11.5B (2024) → $37B (2025) = 3.2x increase DESPITE terrible results

**The Paradox:**
Everyone's buying lottery tickets. Almost nobody's winning. We're in a hype cycle.

## Visual Design Notes

**Layout:** Five distinct sections/icons arranged in circular or grid pattern

**Visual Treatment:**
- Each barrier gets icon + title + 1-2 key statistics
- Icons use EventAI color palette (purple, coral, blue)
- Center callout: "80% report no significant ROI" (electric coral emphasis)
- Festival context: Background festival crowd or stage elements

**Tone:**
- Not doom-and-gloom, but realistic
- These are solvable problems (context: section on "What Actually Works" follows)
- Data-driven, evidence-based
