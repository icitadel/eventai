## Typography

- Title: Inter Bold, 28-32pt, Deep Purple #6B46C1
- Subtitle: Source Sans Pro Regular, 14-16pt, Mid Gray #A0AEC0
- Hero statistic "80%": Inter Bold, 48-56pt, Electric Coral #FF6B6B
- Barrier titles: Inter Bold, 18-20pt, matching barrier color

## Visual Elements

⚠️ CRITICAL FESTIVAL CONTEXT:
- **Illustrated festival crowd visible in background** (subtle, 10-20% opacity)
- Festival stage, tents, or outdoor structures
- Wristbands on attendees
- Make crowd VISIBLE and ILLUSTRATED (not generic tech/business setting)

**Barrier Icons:**
- Each icon distinct and recognizable
- Use EventAI color palette for icons (match barrier color)
- Simple, clean outline style (not overly detailed)
- Icons should feel relevant to festivals, not generic business

**Connecting Elements:**
- Optional: Subtle connecting lines or borders between barriers
- Optional: Pentagon/circular arrangement shows interconnection
- Keep connections minimal (avoid spaghetti diagram)

## STANDARD Density Requirements

⚠️ CRITICAL WHITE SPACE:
- Target 30% white space composition
- Generous padding: 48-64px margins all sides
- 24-32px spacing between barrier sections
- 16-24px padding inside each barrier box

❌ DO NOT ADD:
- Decorative borders around entire graphic or each barrier
- Gradient backgrounds (solid colors only)
- Multiple icons per barrier (one icon max)
- Long explanatory paragraphs (keep to 2-3 bullet points per barrier)

✅ KEEP IT BALANCED:
- Hero statistic immediately grabs attention
- Five barriers clearly separated and scannable
- Visual hierarchy: Hero → Barriers → Footer
- 30-60 second comprehension time

## Target Scan Time

30-60 seconds to understand:
1. 80% organizations see no ROI despite massive investment
2. Five distinct barrier categories
3. Key challenge in each barrier area
4. Only 6% achieve high performance, 1% mature deployment

## Accessibility

- Text contrast minimum 4.5:1 (WCAG AA)
- Information not color-dependent (icons + text + color for each barrier)
- Each barrier distinguishable by icon AND title (not just color)
- Minimum 12pt body text, 10pt for footer

## Festival Context Integration

⚠️ REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP:
- **Illustrated festival crowd visible in background**
- Festival stages, tents, outdoor venue structures
- Wristbands on attendees
- Show diverse festival-goers in casual clothing
- Make setting clearly FESTIVAL, not tech conference or corporate office

❌ NEVER INCLUDE:
- Generic business people in suits
- Corporate office settings (boardrooms, cubicles)
- Robot/AI clichés (circuit brains, evil AI overlords)
- Stadium seating (festivals use open fields/outdoor stages)

## Additional Requirements

**Tone Balance:**
- Realistic but not doom-and-gloom
- Data-driven, evidence-based
- These are solvable problems (implied: section on "What Works" follows)
- Not anti-AI, but pro-implementation-discipline

**Data Accuracy:**
- "80%" must be exact (McKinsey 2025 finding)
- "$11.5B → $37B" must be exact (G2 2025 statistics)
- "$566K" and "$7.44M" must be exact (Forrester TEI 2024)
- "€35M or 7%" must be exact (EU AI Act Regulation 2024/1689)
- "40+" festivals must be exact (Fight for the Future campaign)

**Source Citation:**
- Bottom right corner
- Small text (10-12pt, Mid Gray)
- "Sources: McKinsey 2025, EU AI Act 2024/1689, Forrester TEI 2024"

**Aspect Ratio:**
- SQUARE or LANDSCAPE orientation preferred
- Grid/circular layout works better in square or wider formats
- Recommended: 1536 x 1536 (square) or 2048 x 1536 (landscape)
