## What Changes for Attendees: Before AI vs. After AI

### Festival Discovery and Ticketing

**Before AI:**
- Manual browsing of festival websites and music blogs
- Static tier pricing (early bird, general admission, VIP)
- Schedule conflicts resolved by hand or spreadsheet
- FOMO from missing announcements

**After AI:**
- Personalized festival recommendations based on listening history, social graph, location
- Dynamic pricing that adjusts based on demand (may increase or decrease)
- Automatic schedule generation with conflict resolution
- Proactive alerts for artist announcements, ticket drops, schedule changes

**Real Impact:** DICE's AI recommendations drive **40-41% of ticket sales**, meaning nearly half of festival attendance is now algorithmically curated rather than self-selected. This represents a shift from discovery-by-search to discovery-by-algorithm that fundamentally changes how attendees find festivals.

### On-Site Experience

**Before AI:**
- Paper maps and static signage
- Uniform experience for all attendees
- Fixed food/beverage menus regardless of demand
- Security via manual inspection and static cameras
- Lost friends = wandering or meeting at designated spots

**After AI:**
- Mobile apps with real-time wayfinding, wait times, crowd density heatmaps
- Personalized itineraries, artist discovery, food recommendations
- Dynamic menu adjustments (if beer sales surge, system auto-orders more; if vegan demand exceeds forecast, vendors pivot)
- AI-enhanced crowd monitoring with proactive congestion prevention (10-minute advance warnings)
- Opt-in location sharing for friend-finding (with explicit consent)

**Real Impact:** Bonnaroo's iBeacon platform delivered 97,000+ contextual notifications over 4 days with **20% engagement rate**—attendees voluntarily interacted with 1 in 5 notifications because content was relevant to their location and needs.

**What Attendees Find Helpful vs. Intrusive:**

**Helpful Features (Consistently Praised):**
- Schedule management tools with lock screen widgets and live activities
- Artist discovery via Spotify/Apple Music integration
- Emergency and weather alerts (Lollapalooza's thunderstorm evacuation reached 90% of app users within minutes)
- Interactive maps with walking time estimates between stages
- Wayfinding to hydration stations and services

**Intrusive Features (Consistent Complaints):**
- Persistent location tracking that drains batteries
- Privacy settings that auto-reset to enable tracking
- Over-notification (1 notification/day yields 88% 3-month retention vs. 54% retention with 5 notifications/day)
- Sponsor pushes perceived as spam
- Mandatory app downloads for wristband registration forcing data collection

**The Privacy Threshold:** When iOS shifted to requiring explicit notification opt-in, **44-56% of users declined**—suggesting that passive consent dramatically overstates true acceptance of personalization. The threshold between helpful and intrusive hinges on **user control**, **transparency**, and **frequency limits**.

### Post-Festival

**Before AI:**
- Manual photo sharing
- Generic surveys ("Rate your experience 1-5")
- Memory limited to what attendees captured personally

**After AI:**
- Automatic highlight reels (if attendees opt in to photo/video capture)
- AI-generated recap videos showing "your festival journey" with anonymized crowd shots, set times attended, distance walked
- Hyper-targeted surveys ("You spent 45 minutes in the EDM tent but didn't return—what would have brought you back?")
- Recommendations for next year's lineup based on actual behavior, not stated preferences

**Privacy Note:** All of this requires explicit opt-in. GDPR and emerging regulations mandate that passive data collection (what AI observes) cannot be used for secondary purposes without consent. Responsible implementation offers value exchange: "Share your movement data → Get personalized recap video."

- **40-41%** of DICE ticket sales come from AI recommendations (not direct search)
- **20%** engagement rate with Bonnaroo's location-aware notifications (97,000+ sent)
- **90%** of Lollapalooza app users reached within minutes for emergency alerts
- **88%** 3-month retention with 1 notification/day
- **54%** retention with 5 notifications/day (over-notification penalty)
- **44-56%** of iOS users decline notification permissions when asked explicitly

## Visual Structure Recommendation

**Layout**: Side-by-side comparison organized into three horizontal bands:

1. **DISCOVERY & TICKETING** (Top band)
   - Left: Before AI (manual browsing, static pricing, spreadsheet scheduling)
   - Right: After AI (algorithmic recommendations, dynamic pricing, auto-scheduling)
   - Stat callout: "40-41% of tickets now sold via AI recommendations"

2. **ON-SITE EXPERIENCE** (Middle band)
   - Left: Before AI (paper maps, uniform experience, manual security)
   - Right: After AI (real-time wayfinding, personalization, proactive crowd monitoring)
   - Stat callout: "20% engagement rate with contextual notifications"

3. **POST-FESTIVAL** (Bottom band)
   - Left: Before AI (manual photos, generic surveys)
   - Right: After AI (AI-generated recaps, hyper-targeted surveys, behavioral recommendations)
   - Privacy note: "All requires explicit opt-in under GDPR"

**Color coding:**
- Before AI: Neutral grayscale or muted tones
- After AI: EventAI brand colors (deep purple, electric coral, sky blue)
- Privacy/consent elements: Highlighted in distinct color (amber warning tone)

**Icons & Visual Elements:**
- Discovery: Phone screens, ticket stubs, calendar grids
- On-Site: Festival stages, crowds, mobile app interfaces, wristbands
- Post-Festival: Photo galleries, video reels, survey forms
- Privacy: Lock icons, consent checkboxes, opt-in toggles
