# VIS-1.3: Barriers to AI Transformation - Generation Instructions

**Infographic**: Five Barriers to AI Transformation at Festivals
**Status**: ✅ OPTIMIZED - Ready to regenerate with improved prompts
**Last Updated**: December 28, 2025 (post 6-variant evaluation)
**Estimated time**: ~20 minutes total

---

## 🎯 Recommendation After 6-Variant Evaluation

**Evaluation Results:**
- ✅ Variant #6 (pentagon + external text): **79/100** - **PREFERRED** for aesthetic engagement
- ✅ Variant #3 (pentagon + white center): **86/100** - Strongest technical scores
- ⚠️ Variant #4 (vertical list): **88/100** - Technically highest but sterile/boring (reject)
- ⚠️ Other pentagon variants: **68-70/100** - Various issues

**Decision:** **Pentagon layouts are aesthetically engaging and match EventAI brand** (professional + whimsy). Variant #6's external text approach or Variant #3's white center both create visual interest. **Avoid boring vertical stacks** - technical perfection without personality is not the goal.

**Critical Issues Found (ALL variants):**
- ❌ Beige/cream backgrounds (NOT pure white #FFFFFF) - #1 issue
- ❌ Generic business icons (money bags, gears) - need festival-specific
- ⚠️ Some low white space (<30% minimum)
- ⚠️ Text sizes inconsistent

**Prompts below incorporate ALL learnings. Two aesthetically engaging options:**
1. **PENTAGON + WHITE CENTER** (Variant #3 style - clean, striking visual impact)
2. **PENTAGON + EXTERNAL TEXT** (Variant #6 style - spacious, highly readable)

Pentagon diagram: 5 Major Barriers to AI Transformation at Festivals

🚨 CRITICAL: Pure white background #FFFFFF (NOT cream/beige/off-white), white center circle, 30%+ white space, festival-specific icons

STRUCTURE:
- Pentagon with 5 equal wedge segments radiating from center
- White center circle containing title: "5 Major Barriers to AI Transformation"
- Each wedge: colored background + icon + bold title + hero stat + 2-line description

BARRIERS (clockwise from top, equal visual weight):

- Equal segments: Each wedge exactly same size, no hierarchy

❌ AVOID:
- Cream/beige/off-white backgrounds (#F5F5DC, #F7F3ED, #FEFDFB) - must be pure #FFFFFF
- Generic business icons (money bags, handshakes, office workers, plain gears)
- Text <14pt (too small for print)
- Cramped layouts with <25% white space
- Unequal segment sizes
- Decorative borders or unnecessary shapes
- Dark/heavy backgrounds

✅ PERFECT EXAMPLE REFERENCE:

## 💎 OPTION B: Pentagon + External Text (Aesthetically Engaging Alternative)

**Why:** Spacious, highly readable, creative text placement, visually interesting

**Copy this prompt** (token-optimized 285 tokens):

```
Pentagon infographic with external text: 5 Major Barriers to AI Transformation at Festivals

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 🔴 Background is cream/beige (not white)

**Problem:** NotebookLM defaults to warm backgrounds
**Solution:** Add to prompt: "Background must be EXACTLY #FFFFFF pure white. Use color picker to verify. NOT #F5F5F5, NOT #FEFDFB, NOT cream."
**Prevention:** Emphasize in CAPS: "🚨 PURE WHITE #FFFFFF BACKGROUND"

### 🔴 Icons are generic business imagery

**Problem:** AI defaults to common business metaphors
**Solution:** Add to prompt: "Festival context: outdoor concert stages, crowd formations, RFID wristbands, festival tents. AVOID: office workers, handshakes, suits, generic gears."
**Prevention:** List specific festival elements, use "NOT" to block generic images

### 🔴 Text too small to read

**Problem:** AI tries to fit too much in small space
**Solution:** Add to prompt: "Body text MINIMUM 14pt (16pt preferred). Titles 20-24pt. Stats 32-40pt. Print-ready sizes."
**Prevention:** Specify exact point sizes for each text level

### 🔴 Low white space / cramped layout

**Problem:** AI fills every gap
**Solution:** Add to prompt: "40% white space MINIMUM. Strategic emptiness creates visual power. Don't fill every gap."
**Prevention:** Specify percentage, use "generous," "breathing room," "don't cram"

### 🔴 Pentagon segments unequal

**Problem:** AI struggles with perfect geometric division
**Solution:** Add to prompt: "Pentagon with EXACTLY EQUAL wedge sizes. Geometric precision. Each barrier has identical visual weight."
**Prevention:** Emphasize "exactly equal," "geometric division"

### 🔴 Statistics incorrect or missing

**Problem:** AI misreads source or halluccinates
**Solution:** Verify source uploaded correctly, include stats in prompt explicitly
**Prevention:** List key stats in prompt: "$566K, 80%+, €35M, 10+, cold-start"

## Key Learnings from 6-Variant Evaluation

### What Worked (Keep Doing)

✅ **Pentagon + white center circle** (Variant #3, 86/100)
- Creates strong visual focal point
- Better brand fit (professional + whimsy)
- More memorable than vertical list
- Signature EventAI visual pattern

✅ **Festival-specific contexts** (when present)
- Annual events = 1 training opportunity/year (perfect phrasing)
- Temporary environments, harsh conditions (evokes festival reality)
- Serendipity vs. optimization (captures ethical tension)

✅ **Bold statistics** in colored text
- $566K, 80%, €35M, 10+ stand out
- Easy to scan and remember
- Creates visual hierarchy

### What Failed (Stop Doing)

❌ **Beige/cream backgrounds** (Variants 1-3, 5-6)
- EventAI requires pure white #FFFFFF
- Cream (#F5F5DC, #F7F3ED, #FEFDFB) reduces contrast and brand consistency
- Single biggest issue across all pentagon variants

❌ **Generic business icons** (all variants)
- Money bags, plain gears, generic scales not festival-specific
- Could be for any industry (banking, manufacturing, healthcare)
- Need: stages, crowds, wristbands, RFID, festival tents

❌ **Low white space** (<30%, Variants 1, 2, 5)
- Feels cramped and cluttered
- Reduces perceived quality
- Violates EventAI 30% minimum standard

❌ **Small text** (<14pt, some variants)
- Difficult to read in print
- Accessibility issue
- Below EventAI minimum standard

### Critical Success Factors

**For Pentagon Layout:**
1. Pure white background (#FFFFFF) - non-negotiable
2. White center circle (Variant #3 approach) - creates focal point
3. Exactly equal segment sizes - geometric precision
4. 30-35% white space minimum - let it breathe
5. Festival-specific icons - avoid business clichés

**For Vertical List:**
1. Pure white background (#FFFFFF) - non-negotiable
2. Left-aligned text - style guide requirement
3. 40%+ white space (right side) - breathing room
4. Minimum 14pt body text - readability
5. Festival-specific icons - avoid generic imagery

**Both Layouts:**
- EventAI color palette (exact hex codes)
- Bold statistics (32-40pt)
- Minimal decoration (high data-ink ratio)
- Festival context (crowds, stages, wristbands, RFID)
- 100% data accuracy (verify against source)

## Advanced: Prompt Optimization Notes

### Token Efficiency Strategies Used

**Pentagon prompt: 312 tokens** (optimized from ~450)
- Removed redundant phrasing
- Used emojis for critical flags (🚨)
- Combined related requirements
- Numbered barriers for clarity
- Used exact hex codes (no explanations)

**Vertical list prompt: 268 tokens** (optimized from ~380)
- Streamlined structure description
- Consolidated color + text specifications
- Removed duplicate guidance
- Direct, imperative phrasing

### What NOT to Optimize Out

**Keep these even though they add tokens:**
- Exact hex codes (#FF6B6B) - precision matters
- "NOT cream/beige" examples - AI needs negative examples
- Minimum text sizes (14pt) - accessibility critical
- Festival-specific icon examples - guides AI away from generic

**Okay to remove:**
- Explanatory text ("this creates...")
- Redundant modifiers ("very important")
- Multiple ways of saying same thing
- Background rationale (save for instructions doc)

### 2. Reference in Draft

Add to `transformation.draft.md` after "The Barriers" section:
```markdown
![Five Barriers to AI Transformation](../visuals/barriers/transformation-infographic-barriers-X.webp)
```

### 3. Generate Remaining Visuals

**Transformation topic progress:**
- ✅ VIS-1.1: AI Adoption Timeline
- ✅ VIS-1.2: Before/After Comparison
