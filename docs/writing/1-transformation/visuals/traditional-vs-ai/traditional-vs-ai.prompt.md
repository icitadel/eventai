- Festival stages, tents, or structures on both sides

- Make crowds VISIBLE and ILLUSTRATED (not just subtle silhouettes)

**Other Icons:**
- Laptop, smartphone, paper map, Spotify logo
- Crowd monitoring symbols (dashboard, alerts)

- Simple outline style, minimal detail

## STANDARD Density Requirements

⚠️ CRITICAL WHITE SPACE:
- Target 30% white space composition
- Generous padding: 48-64px margins all sides
- 24-32px spacing between comparison rows
- 16-24px padding inside each comparison item

❌ DO NOT ADD:
- Decorative borders around entire graphic or sections
- Gradient backgrounds (except subtle divider treatment)
- Multiple icons per comparison item
- Excessive explanatory text (keep to 3-5 words per item)

✅ KEEP IT BALANCED:
- Clear left-right split with obvious visual contrast
- Five comparison rows maximum (manageable scan)
- Reality check callout provides context
- 30-60 second comprehension time

## Target Scan Time

30-60 seconds to understand:
1. Traditional 2025 baseline experience
2. AI-optimized 2035 transformation
3. Five key difference areas
4. 40% of sales already AI-driven today

## Accessibility

- Text contrast minimum 4.5:1 (WCAG AA)
- Information not color-dependent (icons + text + color on both sides)
- Left vs right distinguishable by visual treatment AND labels
- Minimum 12pt body text, 14pt for headers

## Festival Context Integration

⚠️ REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP:
- **Illustrated festival crowd visible in background on BOTH sides**
- Left side: Traditional festival crowd (grayscale or muted colors)
- Right side: Modern festival crowd (EventAI full color palette)
- Festival stages, tents, outdoor venue structures on both sides
- Wristbands visible on attendees
- Show diverse festival-goers in casual clothing

❌ NEVER INCLUDE:
- Generic business people in suits
- Corporate office settings
- Robot/AI clichés (circuit brains, android overlords)
- Stadium seating (festivals use open fields/outdoor stages)

## Additional Requirements

**Visual Contrast:**
- Left side should feel functional but dated (not bad, just traditional)
- Right side should feel modern and vibrant (not futuristic sci-fi)
- Clear progression arrow or indicator showing 2025 → 2035 evolution
- Both sides should maintain festival authenticity (not tech conference)

**Data Accuracy:**
- "40%" statistic must be prominent in reality check callout
- "10 minutes" advance warning time mentioned in safety row
- Years "2025" and "2035" clearly labeled

**Source Citation:**
- Bottom right corner or bottom center
- Small text (10-12pt, Mid Gray)
- "Sources: DICE 2025, EventAI Curriculum"

**Aspect Ratio:**
- ⚠️ **LANDSCAPE orientation REQUIRED** (not portrait)
- Horizontal split design maximizes comparison effectiveness
- VETO: Portrait orientation = automatic disqualification regardless of other scores
- Recommended: 2048 x 1536 (landscape) or 1920 x 1080
