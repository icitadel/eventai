# Question 2: Critical AI Literacy in Education

> **For university students pursuing degrees in event management, why is learning about AI not just about using the tools (functional literacy), but also about understanding its ethical, economic, and philosophical implications (critical literacy)?**

**Context**: This question addresses the gap between AI tool proficiency and deeper critical understanding, examining why event management education must go beyond technical skills to include ethical reasoning, social justice dimensions, and systemic implications of AI deployment.

## The Question Nobody Prepared You to Answer

Picture yourself two years from now. You're interviewing for a festival director position, and they ask: "A vendor's proposing AI crowd monitoring with 92% accuracy. Should we buy it?"

What do you say? 92% sounds good, right? But compared to what baseline? What counts as "accurate"—a 5-minute prediction window or 30-minute? Were test conditions representative of outdoor festivals with spotty WiFi? Who funded the study—independent researchers or the vendor? Is the system GDPR-compliant for biometric data? Does it exhibit demographic bias?

Here's the uncomfortable truth: your event management degree probably didn't give you frameworks to answer any of those questions. Research across 12 major universities in the US, UK, and Australia reveals that only three programs explicitly integrate AI into hospitality curricula, and zero event management programs offer dedicated AI literacy courses.

Meanwhile, the industry races ahead. 71% of hospitality organizations report AI/robotics skills gaps. The event tech sector is projected to grow from $1.8 billion to $14.2 billion by 2033. You're graduating into an AI-saturated industry without systematic training in the technology reshaping your field.

The gap isn't about using ChatGPT to write event descriptions—that's functional literacy, and you can learn it in a weekend. The critical gap is understanding whose interests AI serves, how to evaluate vendor claims, when deployment is inappropriate, and what happens when algorithmic systems fail. That's critical AI literacy, and it's almost entirely absent from event management education.

## Two Types of AI Literacy: Why the Distinction Matters

### Functional AI Literacy: Operating the Tools

Here's the definition researchers use: "A set of competencies that enables individuals to critically evaluate AI technologies; communicate and collaborate effectively with AI; and use AI as a tool online, at home, and in the workplace" (Long & Magerko, 2020).

The core questions are operational: *How does AI work?* *What can AI do?* *Which tools should I use for this task?*

At festivals, that means using ChatGPT to draft event descriptions, operating predictive analytics dashboards for ticket forecasting, implementing chatbots for customer service, deploying AI-powered scheduling tools for vendor placement.

Cornell eCornell's AI in Hospitality Certificate shows what functional training looks like. It's a 5.5-day program costing $3,600 that teaches ChatGPT for content creation, automation tools like Zapier for workflow efficiency, BigML for predictive modeling, and data visualization techniques. You finish knowing how to operate specific platforms. What you don't finish with: frameworks for evaluating whether deployment is appropriate, ethical, or aligned with organizational values.

---

### Critical AI Literacy: Questioning the Systems

The questions shift here: *Whose interests does this AI serve?* *How does this system embed values?* *Who benefits and who bears costs?* *What are the unintended consequences?*

UNESCO's AI Competency Framework identifies three critical dimensions: ensuring AI enhances rather than replaces human judgment (human-centered mindset), understanding fairness, transparency, accountability, and bias (ethics of AI), and evaluating whether AI promotes equity or reinforces power structures (critical assessment).

Consider the festival applications you'll face as a professional. A vendor proposes AI-driven dynamic pricing to increase ticket revenue by 20-30%. Critical literacy asks: Does surge pricing exclude lower-income attendees? Does it contradict your festival's stated mission of accessibility? Who profits from increased prices—your organization, ticket platforms, shareholders, or artists? What happens to festival culture when pricing algorithms treat attendance as pure market transaction?

Security proposes opt-in facial entry to speed admission. Critical questions: What happens to attendees who decline—are they penalized with longer waits? How is biometric data stored and who owns it? Does the system exhibit demographic bias in recognition accuracy? What are the long-term implications of normalizing biometric surveillance at cultural events?

A social media monitoring tool flags "concerning" attendee posts. Who defines "concerning"? Who sets the parameters? Could this suppress legitimate criticism or activism?

Here's the fundamental gap: while functional AI literacy teaches you *how to use* ChatGPT to write a festival schedule, critical AI literacy asks *whether AI-generated schedules prioritize sponsor visibility over attendee experience*.

*Figure 1: Functional AI literacy focuses on tool usage and "how/what" questions, while critical AI literacy addresses ethical evaluation through "why/who" questions and frameworks for assessing bias and power dynamics.*

## The Academic Void: Where Three Programs Stand Alone

Here's where it gets bleak. Across 12 major universities in the US, UK, and Australia, only three programs explicitly integrate AI into hospitality curricula, and zero event management programs offer dedicated AI literacy courses.

University of Surrey represents the strongest integration found. Their BSc International Tourism/Hospitality/Event Management includes AI applications in MAN2220 Visitor Attraction Management—an optional module covering VR, AR, and AI alongside ethics of technology deployment. The postgraduate core module MANM432 Smart Tourism and Events Design addresses big data analytics and IoT integration. Surrey's Centre for Digital Transformation in the Visitor Economy lists "Artificial intelligence and robotics" as a core research theme, and they've established a Senior Lecturer in AI and the Future of Work position.

Sounds promising until you realize: even here, AI content is embedded within broader modules rather than standalone courses, and critical AI literacy gets minimal attention beyond generic "ethical issues" mentions.

Southern Cross University takes a more operational approach. Their Bachelor of Business in Hotel Management requires HOTL3006 Hospitality Information and Technology Systems, which covers automation and robotics, data mining, and guest-centric technologies. The learning outcome says students will "Critically analyse the role of management in digital information systems"—suggesting some critical thinking component. But there's no evidence of ethics-specific modules addressing algorithmic bias, surveillance implications, or power dynamics.

Penn State's Master of Professional Studies in Hospitality Management offers HM 830 Hospitality Data Analytics as a required graduate course, teaching predictive analytics, data visualization, and decision support systems. While predictive analytics inherently involves machine learning, the course doesn't explicitly frame content as "AI literacy." This reflects a broader pattern where data analytics courses teach AI techniques without addressing AI-specific ethical considerations or societal impacts.

For event management programs specifically, the gap widens to a void. Leeds Beckett University's UK Centre for Events Management—one of the largest dedicated programs globally—includes "websites and event technologies such as e-ticketing, QR codes, and RFID" but offers no AI, machine learning, or data analytics modules. UCF Rosen College lists an HFT 3443 Event Technology course, but no documented AI content exists. While their Hospitality+ Center for Innovation announced an "AI-Enhanced Guest Services Lab," it remains research infrastructure, not integrated into degree requirements.

You're graduating with zero systematic AI education specific to your discipline. You might take general university AI literacy courses—like the University of Florida's institution-wide requirement—but event-specific applications, ethical dilemmas, and industry case studies? Absent.

## Why Industry Outpaced Academia (And Why That's a Problem)

### Professional Certifications Fill the Gap

While universities deliberate curriculum changes, professional organizations moved fast. Meeting Professionals International (MPI) launched their AI-Enhanced Event Professional Certificate in November 2023—barely a year after ChatGPT's release. Over 500 event planners have completed the 7.5 CMP clock hour program, which costs $305-$405 and covers AI concepts, chatbots, predictive analytics, AI-powered event management software, and personalized marketing.

The classification? Primarily functional AI literacy. Using tools, not questioning their deployment.

The Professional Convention Management Association (PCMA) Institute offers a parallel Enhancing Events with AI Certificate taught by Nick Borelli, Zenus Director of Marketing. The program runs 7.5 CMP hours at $556-$695, covering AI platforms, marketing automation, audience engagement, logistics automation, and predictive analytics. PCMA's Project Spark platform, launched in May 2023, now serves over 3,000 event professionals who use generative AI for agenda development, content creation, and speaker biographies.

The contrast with university programs is stark. MPI and PCMA launched certificates within months of ChatGPT's November 2022 release, while universities remain in planning stages as of 2025. The certifications cost $300-700 versus degree tuition, run in evenings and weekends versus semester-long commitments, and focus on industry-facing use cases rather than theoretical foundations.

Neither makes any pretense of covering ethics deeply. But then again, neither do most university programs that do exist.

### Why Universities Lag: Structural Barriers

The academic slowness isn't laziness—it's structural friction. New courses typically require 12-24 months for committee approvals, syllabus development, and faculty hiring. By the time a 2023 proposal becomes a 2025 course, AI tools have evolved multiple generations.

Faculty in hospitality and event management were trained in operations, marketing, and human resources—not computer science or data ethics. Hiring AI-specialized faculty requires budget allocations and searches taking 1-2 years.

Accreditation constraints compound the problem. Hospitality programs must meet accreditor requirements covering operations, finance, HR, and marketing. Adding AI means reducing time for established content. And faculty promotion depends heavily on peer-reviewed research, not teaching innovation, creating misaligned incentives where developing new AI pedagogy counts less than publishing AI research papers.

Here's the most damning stat: only 3% of hospitality organizations use higher education for digital training. Industry isn't waiting for universities to catch up. They're building their own training infrastructure.

## The Critical Literacy Void: What Nobody's Teaching You

Across all programs examined—university courses and professional certificates—critical AI literacy content is virtually absent. Here's what that means when you're actually working.

You'll learn how to read a vendor dashboard showing "92% prediction accuracy" but never ask: 92% accurate compared to what baseline? What counts as a "prediction"? Were test conditions representative? Who funded the study? You'll accept vendor metrics at face value, purchasing systems that underperform promises because you lack frameworks to evaluate evidence rigor.

You'll learn how to use AI recruitment tools to screen festival staff applications but won't question whether the algorithm penalizes résumés from candidates with non-traditional career paths, whether certain demographic groups are disproportionately filtered out, what training data was used, or who's liable when biased hiring results in discrimination lawsuits. You'll deploy AI hiring tools without auditing for bias, perpetuating existing inequities in the festival workforce.

You'll learn how to implement dynamic ticket pricing to "optimize revenue" without asking: Optimize for whom—the festival, artists, or attendees? Does surge pricing exclude lower-income fans, contradicting stated values of diversity and inclusion? Who profits—ticket platforms, shareholders, or artists? What happens to festival culture when pricing algorithms treat attendance as pure market transaction?

The result: 91% of UK fans oppose dynamic pricing, and regulatory investigations from UK Parliament to Australian ban proposals suggest public backlash you weren't trained to anticipate.

You'll learn how to deploy facial recognition for faster festival entry without understanding whether biometric data processing is proportionate to the goal, what happens to attendees who decline, whether consent is genuinely voluntary, or what the long-term implications are of normalizing biometric surveillance at cultural events.

The Danish Data Protection Authority approved facial recognition for football matches—where documented violence exists—but explicitly denied it for concerts at the same venue. If you don't understand proportionality principles, you'll deploy systems that regulators halt, wasting resources and damaging trust.

---

## What You Need vs. What You're Getting

Where AI training exists at all, you'll graduate knowing how to use ChatGPT to draft event marketing copy, understanding that predictive analytics can forecast attendance, knowing that AI chatbots can handle customer service, and being aware that RFID and facial recognition technologies exist.

But you won't be able to evaluate whether a vendor's claimed "78% yield improvement" is credible. You'll be unaware of GDPR Article 9 requirements for biometric data processing. You'll lack frameworks for assessing algorithmic bias in hiring or pricing systems. You'll struggle to articulate when human judgment should override AI recommendations.

Here's what you actually need: dual competency. Functionally, you should deploy AI tools appropriately for content creation, scheduling, and analytics; interpret data visualizations and predictive model outputs; select appropriate AI applications for specific festival challenges; troubleshoot common AI tool failures.

Critically, you should evaluate vendor claims using evidence-based frameworks with baseline comparisons, independent validation, and sample sizes; assess regulatory compliance for GDPR, BIPA, and CCPA when AI systems process personal data; audit AI systems for demographic bias and fairness; articulate ethical trade-offs between efficiency and privacy, personalization and filter bubbles, automation and employment; advocate for responsible AI deployment that aligns with organizational values.

The gap between what you need and what you're getting isn't small. It's the difference between being a thoughtful decision-maker and being a conduit for uncritical technology adoption.

## The 71% Skills Gap and Who Pays for It

A 2024 UK study found that 71% of hospitality organizations report AI/robotics skills gaps, yet only 3% use higher education for digital training. This creates a vicious cycle.

Industry says: "Universities don't teach relevant AI skills, so we train in-house or hire external consultants."

Universities respond: "Industry changes so fast we can't keep curricula current, and our faculty lack AI expertise."

You bear the consequence: entry-level festival professionals lack both functional skills for operating AI tools and critical frameworks for evaluating ethical implications. You're forced to learn on the job—often from vendors with incentives to oversell capabilities and downplay risks.

The societal consequence extends beyond your career. AI systems get deployed at festivals without adequate oversight because decision-makers lack training to recognize when deployment is inappropriate, non-compliant, or harmful. The documented failures suggest skills gaps have real consequences: €200,000 in GDPR fines for events deploying biometric systems without adequate data protection impact assessments, wrongful arrests via facial recognition, 42% of organizations reporting zero ROI on AI investments—often because tools were deployed without understanding limitations or fit.

![Skills Gap Vicious Cycle](../visuals/skills-gap-cycle/skills-gap-cycle-3.webp)
*Figure 3: The vicious cycle reinforcing AI skills gaps in event management education. Universities can't keep up with industry changes, so organizations train in-house. Graduates lack critical literacy, forcing reliance on vendor-led training that perpetuates the gap.*

## The Bottom Line: What You're Walking Into

You're entering an AI-saturated industry without systematic AI education. Functional AI literacy is necessary but insufficient. Without critical AI literacy—the ability to question vendor claims, assess bias, evaluate proportionality, advocate for values-aligned deployment—you become a conduit for uncritical technology adoption rather than a thoughtful decision-maker.

The evidence suggests this isn't hypothetical risk. 42% of organizations report zero ROI from AI investments, often because tools were deployed without understanding limitations or fit. Events have incurred €200,000 in GDPR fines for deploying biometric systems without adequate legal analysis. Festival organizers initially failed to anticipate public resistance to facial recognition and dynamic pricing, leading to 91% of UK fans opposing algorithmic ticket pricing and regulatory investigations across multiple countries.

For you entering the festival industry, the question isn't whether you'll encounter AI—it's whether you'll have frameworks to deploy it responsibly. The current education landscape provides a clear answer: you won't, unless universities and professional organizations urgently prioritize critical AI literacy alongside functional skills.

The choice facing hospitality and event management education is stark: evolve curricula to prepare graduates for an AI-shaped industry, or continue producing professionals who lack the competencies their employers desperately need and society increasingly demands.

As a student, you can't wait for the system to catch up. Seek out AI literacy training wherever you can find it—MPI/PCMA certifications, computer science electives, online courses, industry publications. Ask questions in interviews about how organizations evaluate AI vendors, assess bias, ensure compliance. Build the critical literacy your degree didn't provide, because the industry won't wait for you to figure it out on the job.

That's the uncomfortable truth about your education gap. The transformation is happening with or without you. Critical AI literacy determines whether you'll be shaping that transformation or scrambling to catch up.
