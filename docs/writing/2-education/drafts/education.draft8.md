# Question 2: Critical AI Literacy in Education

> **For university students pursuing degrees in event management, why is learning about AI not just about using the tools (functional literacy), but also about understanding its ethical, economic, and philosophical implications (critical literacy)?**

**Context**: This question addresses the gap between AI tool proficiency and deeper critical understanding, examining why event management education must go beyond technical skills to include ethical reasoning, social justice dimensions, and systemic implications of AI deployment.

# Why Your Degree Isn't Teaching You What You'll Actually Need

**Learning Objectives:**
- Distinguish between functional AI literacy (tool use) and critical AI literacy (ethical evaluation)
- Identify critical questions event professionals must answer when deploying AI
- Assess consequences of lacking critical frameworks for AI evaluation
- Evaluate what constitutes adequate AI literacy for event management careers

## The Question Nobody Prepared You to Answer

Picture yourself two years from now. You're interviewing for a festival director position, and they ask: "A vendor's proposing AI crowd monitoring with 92% accuracy. Should we buy it?"

What do you say? 92% sounds good, right? But compared to what baseline? What counts as "accurate"—a 5-minute prediction window or 30-minute? Were test conditions representative of outdoor festivals with spotty WiFi? Who funded the study—independent researchers or the vendor? Is the system GDPR-compliant for biometric data? Does it exhibit demographic bias?

Here's the uncomfortable truth: your event management degree probably didn't give you frameworks to answer any of those questions. Research across 12 major universities in the US, UK, and Australia reveals that only three programs explicitly integrate AI into hospitality curricula, and zero event management programs offer dedicated AI literacy courses.

Meanwhile, the industry races ahead. 71% of hospitality organizations report AI/robotics skills gaps. The event tech sector is projected to grow from $1.8 billion to $14.2 billion by 2033. You're graduating into an AI-saturated industry without systematic training in the technology reshaping your field.

The gap isn't about using ChatGPT to write event descriptions—that's functional literacy, and you can learn it in a weekend. The critical gap is understanding whose interests AI serves, how to evaluate vendor claims, when deployment is inappropriate, and what happens when algorithmic systems fail. That's critical AI literacy, and it's almost entirely absent from event management education.

## Two Types of AI Literacy: Why the Distinction Matters

### Functional AI Literacy: Operating the Tools

Here's the definition researchers use: "A set of competencies that enables individuals to critically evaluate AI technologies; communicate and collaborate effectively with AI; and use AI as a tool online, at home, and in the workplace" (Long & Magerko, 2020).

The core questions are operational: *How does AI work?* *What can AI do?* *Which tools should I use for this task?*

At festivals, that means using ChatGPT to draft event descriptions, operating predictive analytics dashboards for ticket forecasting, implementing chatbots for customer service, deploying AI-powered scheduling tools for vendor placement.

This is what most available training focuses on. Professional certifications like MPI's AI-Enhanced Event Professional Certificate (launched November 2023, 500+ completers) or PCMA's Enhancing Events with AI program teach platform operation, automation workflows, and marketing applications. You finish knowing how to operate specific tools.

What you don't finish with: frameworks for evaluating whether deployment is appropriate, ethical, or aligned with organizational values.

### Critical AI Literacy: Questioning the Systems

The questions shift here: *Whose interests does this AI serve?* *How does this system embed values?* *Who benefits and who bears costs?* *What are the unintended consequences?*

UNESCO's AI Competency Framework identifies three critical dimensions: ensuring AI enhances rather than replaces human judgment (human-centered mindset), understanding fairness, transparency, accountability, and bias (ethics of AI), and evaluating whether AI promotes equity or reinforces power structures (critical assessment).

Consider the festival applications you'll face as a professional. A vendor proposes AI-driven dynamic pricing to increase ticket revenue by 20-30%. Critical literacy asks: Does surge pricing exclude lower-income attendees? Does it contradict your festival's stated mission of accessibility? Who profits from increased prices—your organization, ticket platforms, shareholders, or artists? What happens to festival culture when pricing algorithms treat attendance as pure market transaction?

Security proposes opt-in facial entry to speed admission. Critical questions: What happens to attendees who decline—are they penalized with longer waits? How is biometric data stored and who owns it? Does the system exhibit demographic bias in recognition accuracy? What are the long-term implications of normalizing biometric surveillance at cultural events?

A social media monitoring tool flags "concerning" attendee posts. Who defines "concerning"? Who sets the parameters? Could this suppress legitimate criticism or activism?

Here's the fundamental gap: while functional AI literacy teaches you *how to use* ChatGPT to write a festival schedule, critical AI literacy asks *whether AI-generated schedules prioritize sponsor visibility over attendee experience*.

![Functional vs. Critical AI Literacy](../visuals/literacy-comparison/literacy-comparison-1.png)
*Figure 1: Functional AI literacy focuses on tool usage and "how/what" questions, while critical AI literacy addresses ethical evaluation through "why/who" questions and frameworks for assessing bias and power dynamics.*

## The Academic Gap

Here's where it gets bleak. Across major universities in the US, UK, and Australia, only three hospitality programs explicitly integrate AI into curricula—and zero dedicated event management programs offer AI literacy courses.

Where AI training exists, it's embedded in broader technology modules or data analytics courses. The focus is overwhelmingly functional: how to use tools, not whether to deploy them. Critical AI literacy—ethics, bias auditing, regulatory compliance, power dynamics—gets minimal attention beyond generic "ethical issues" mentions.

You're graduating with zero systematic AI education specific to your discipline. You might take general university AI literacy courses, but event-specific applications, ethical dilemmas, and industry case studies? Absent.

Meanwhile, professional certifications launched within months of ChatGPT's November 2022 release fill the functional gap but make no pretense of covering critical literacy deeply. Only 3% of hospitality organizations use higher education for digital training—they're building their own infrastructure focused on operational skills, not ethical frameworks.

*Figure 2: While industry races ahead with AI adoption (71% report skills gaps, $14.2B market by 2033), academia lags behind (only 3/12 event management programs include AI, 0 dedicated courses). The gap has widened dramatically since ChatGPT's release in November 2022.*

## The Critical Literacy Void: What Nobody's Teaching You

Here's what the absence of critical AI literacy means when you're actually working.

You'll learn how to read a vendor dashboard showing "92% prediction accuracy" but never ask: 92% accurate compared to what baseline? What counts as a "prediction"? Were test conditions representative? Who funded the study? You'll accept vendor metrics at face value, purchasing systems that underperform promises because you lack frameworks to evaluate evidence rigor.

You'll learn how to use AI recruitment tools to screen festival staff applications but won't question whether the algorithm penalizes résumés from candidates with non-traditional career paths, whether certain demographic groups are disproportionately filtered out, what training data was used, or who's liable when biased hiring results in discrimination lawsuits. You'll deploy AI hiring tools without auditing for bias, perpetuating existing inequities in the festival workforce.

You'll learn how to implement dynamic ticket pricing to "optimize revenue" without asking: Optimize for whom—the festival, artists, or attendees? Does surge pricing exclude lower-income fans, contradicting stated values of diversity and inclusion? Who profits—ticket platforms, shareholders, or artists? What happens to festival culture when pricing algorithms treat attendance as pure market transaction?

The result: 91% of UK fans oppose dynamic pricing, and regulatory investigations from UK Parliament to Australian ban proposals suggest public backlash you weren't trained to anticipate.

You'll learn how to deploy facial recognition for faster festival entry without understanding whether biometric data processing is proportionate to the goal, what happens to attendees who decline, whether consent is genuinely voluntary, or what the long-term implications are of normalizing biometric surveillance at cultural events.

The Danish Data Protection Authority approved facial recognition for football matches—where documented violence exists—but explicitly denied it for concerts at the same venue. If you don't understand proportionality principles, you'll deploy systems that regulators halt, wasting resources and damaging trust.

![Consequences of the Critical Literacy Void](../visuals/critical-literacy-consequences/critical-literacy-consequences-5.png)
*Figure 3: Four documented consequence paths illustrate the cost of lacking critical AI literacy frameworks: 42% of organizations report zero ROI from AI investments due to uncritical vendor claim acceptance, 91% of UK festival-goers oppose dynamic pricing due to missing ethical analysis, and €200K GDPR fines result from disproportionate biometric processing without proportionality principles.*

## What You Need vs. What You're Getting

Where AI training exists at all, you'll graduate knowing how to use ChatGPT to draft event marketing copy, understanding that predictive analytics can forecast attendance, knowing that AI chatbots can handle customer service, and being aware that RFID and facial recognition technologies exist.

But you won't be able to evaluate whether a vendor's claimed "78% yield improvement" is credible. You'll be unaware of GDPR Article 9 requirements for biometric data processing. You'll lack frameworks for assessing algorithmic bias in hiring or pricing systems. You'll struggle to articulate when human judgment should override AI recommendations.

Here's what you actually need: dual competency.

**Functionally**, you should deploy AI tools appropriately for content creation, scheduling, and analytics; interpret data visualizations and predictive model outputs; select appropriate AI applications for specific festival challenges; troubleshoot common AI tool failures.

**Critically**, you should evaluate vendor claims using evidence-based frameworks with baseline comparisons, independent validation, and sample sizes; assess regulatory compliance for GDPR, BIPA, and CCPA when AI systems process personal data; audit AI systems for demographic bias and fairness; articulate ethical trade-offs between efficiency and privacy, personalization and filter bubbles, automation and employment; advocate for responsible AI deployment that aligns with organizational values.

The gap between what you need and what you're getting isn't small. It's the difference between being a thoughtful decision-maker and being a conduit for uncritical technology adoption.

![What You Need vs. What You're Getting - The Dual Competency Gap](../visuals/dual-competency-framework/dual-competency-framework-2.png)
*Figure 4: Current training provides surface-level tool awareness (narrow column), while industry demands dual competency: functional skills (deploy, interpret, select, troubleshoot) and critical skills (evaluate, assess, audit, articulate, advocate). The visual width gap reflects the competency gap: 71% of organizations report AI skills gaps, yet only 3 of 100 programs provide comprehensive AI literacy training.*

## The Bottom Line: What You're Walking Into

You're entering an AI-saturated industry without systematic AI education. Functional AI literacy is necessary but insufficient. Without critical AI literacy—the ability to question vendor claims, assess bias, evaluate proportionality, advocate for values-aligned deployment—you become a conduit for uncritical technology adoption rather than a thoughtful decision-maker.

The evidence suggests this isn't hypothetical risk. 42% of organizations report zero ROI from AI investments, often because tools were deployed without understanding limitations or fit. Events have incurred €200,000 in GDPR fines for deploying biometric systems without adequate legal analysis. Festival organizers initially failed to anticipate public resistance to facial recognition and dynamic pricing, leading to 91% of UK fans opposing algorithmic ticket pricing and regulatory investigations across multiple countries.

For you entering the festival industry, the question isn't whether you'll encounter AI—it's whether you'll have frameworks to deploy it responsibly. The current education landscape provides a clear answer: you won't, unless universities and professional organizations urgently prioritize critical AI literacy alongside functional skills.

As a student, you can't wait for the system to catch up. Seek out AI literacy training wherever you can find it—MPI/PCMA certifications, computer science electives, online courses, industry publications. Ask questions in interviews about how organizations evaluate AI vendors, assess bias, ensure compliance. Build the critical literacy your degree didn't provide, because the industry won't wait for you to figure it out on the job.

That's the uncomfortable truth about your education gap. The transformation is happening with or without you. Critical AI literacy determines whether you'll be shaping that transformation or scrambling to catch up.
