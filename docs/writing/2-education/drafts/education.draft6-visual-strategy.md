## Infographic Strategy: 4 Visuals

### Infographic 1: Functional vs. Critical AI Literacy ✅ EXISTS (needs regeneration)

**Current file:** `literacy-comparison-1.webp`
**Placement:** After Line 66 (end of "Two Types of AI Literacy" section)
**Status:** REGENERATE without title (current variant has title issue)

**Evaluation findings:**
- Winner: Variant #1 (92/100 if title removed, 56/100 with title)
- Issue: All 3 variants have titles (wrong for embedded context)
- Strengths: Excellent side-by-side layout, festival tent imagery, clear visual distinction

**Current caption (Line 64-65):**
> *Figure 1: Functional AI literacy focuses on tool usage and "how/what" questions, while critical AI literacy addresses ethical evaluation through "why/who" questions and frameworks for assessing bias and power dynamics.*

**Data visualized:**
- **Left (Functional):** Tool usage, "How & What" questions, training examples (ChatGPT for content, predictive analytics, chatbots, scheduling tools)
- **Right (Critical):** Evaluation frameworks, "Why & Who" questions, ethical dimensions (vendor claims scrutiny, bias auditing, regulatory compliance, proportionality assessment)
- **Gap indicators:** 71% organizations lack AI skills, 42% zero ROI from AI investments

**Action required:** Regenerate variant #1 without title

---

### Infographic 2: The Academic Gap 🆕 NEW

**Suggested filename:** `academic-gap-timeline`
**Placement:** After Line 78 (end of "The Academic Gap" section)
**Purpose:** Visualize research findings showing academia lagging while industry races ahead

**Data from draft6 to visualize:**
- **Academia (LEFT/SLOW):**
  - 12 major universities surveyed (US, UK, Australia)
  - Only 3 hospitality programs explicitly integrate AI
  - 0 dedicated event management AI literacy courses
  - Where AI exists: embedded in broader tech modules, functional focus only
  - 3% of hospitality organizations use higher education for digital training

- **Industry (RIGHT/FAST):**
  - 71% of hospitality organizations report AI/robotics skills gaps
  - Event tech sector: $1.8B (current) → $14.2B (2033 projection)
  - Professional certifications launched within months of ChatGPT:
    - ChatGPT released: November 2022
    - MPI AI-Enhanced Event Professional Certificate: November 2023 (500+ completers)
    - PCMA Enhancing Events with AI: 2023 (Nick Borelli)
    - PCMA Project Spark: May 2023 (3,000+ users)

**Visual concept options:**
1. **Timeline comparison:** Two parallel timelines showing Nov 2022 ChatGPT release → Industry rapid response (certs within months) vs. Academia still at 0 dedicated courses
2. **Gap visualization:** Left side showing academia stats (3/12, 0 courses, 3% industry use) vs. right side showing industry demand (71% skills gap, $14.2B growth, 500+ trained via certs)
3. **Race metaphor:** Academia (slow lane, limited resources) vs. Industry (fast lane, rapid scaling)

**Suggested caption:**
> *Figure 2: While the event tech sector races toward $14.2B by 2033 and professional certifications train 500+ planners within months of ChatGPT's release, academia lags: only 3 of 12 major hospitality programs integrate AI, and zero dedicated event management courses exist.*

**Priority:** HIGH - directly supports "The Academic Gap" section's argument

### Infographic 3: Consequences of the Critical Literacy Void 🆕 NEW

**Suggested filename:** `critical-literacy-consequences`
**Placement:** After Line 96 (end of "The Critical Literacy Void" section)
**Purpose:** Answer "why critical literacy matters" through documented failure cascade

**Data from draft6 to visualize:**

**Cascade structure:**
1. **Lacking Critical Frameworks** →
2. **Uncritical Deployment** →
3. **Documented Consequences**

**Four parallel failure paths:**

| Lacking Framework | Uncritical Deployment | Documented Consequences |
|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| No vendor claim evaluation methods | Accept "92% accuracy" at face value | Underperforming systems purchased (42% zero ROI) |
| No bias auditing protocols | AI hiring tools deployed without demographic testing | Discrimination lawsuits, perpetuated workforce inequities |
| No ethical analysis frameworks | Dynamic pricing deployed for "revenue optimization" | 91% UK fan opposition, regulatory investigations (UK Parliament, Australian ban proposals) |
| No proportionality principles | Facial recognition for festival entry | Regulatory halts (Danish DPA denial), €200K GDPR fines (GSMA MWC), wasted resources |

**Visual concept options:**
1. **Four-path flowchart:** Each row shows the cascade from lacking framework → deployment decision → consequence
2. **Vicious cycle:** Circular diagram showing how lacking frameworks leads to failures which reinforce the need for critical literacy
3. **Branching decision tree:** "Critical Literacy?" (No) → leads to 4 documented failure scenarios with real data

**Suggested caption:**
> *Figure 3: Without critical AI literacy frameworks, event professionals deploy systems uncritically, resulting in documented failures: 42% zero ROI from underperforming systems, discrimination lawsuits from unaudited hiring tools, 91% fan opposition to algorithmic pricing, and €200K GDPR fines for disproportionate biometric surveillance.*

**Priority:** CRITICAL - most direct answer to "why critical literacy matters" question

---

### Infographic 4: Dual Competency Framework 🆕 NEW

**Suggested filename:** `dual-competency-framework`
**Placement:** After Line 112 (end of "What You Need vs. What You're Getting" section)
**Purpose:** Show gap between current training (functional only) vs. needed skills (functional + critical)

**Data from draft6 to visualize:**

**What You're Getting (Current Training):**
- Use ChatGPT to draft event marketing copy
- Understand predictive analytics can forecast attendance
- Know AI chatbots can handle customer service
- Aware RFID and facial recognition technologies exist

**What You Actually Need:**

**Functional Competencies:**
- Deploy AI tools appropriately for content creation, scheduling, and analytics
- Interpret data visualizations and predictive model outputs
- Select appropriate AI applications for specific festival challenges
- Troubleshoot common AI tool failures

**Critical Competencies:**
- Evaluate vendor claims using evidence-based frameworks (baseline comparisons, independent validation, sample sizes)
- Assess regulatory compliance (GDPR, BIPA, CCPA) when AI systems process personal data
- Audit AI systems for demographic bias and fairness
- Articulate ethical trade-offs (efficiency vs. privacy, personalization vs. filter bubbles, automation vs. employment)
- Advocate for responsible AI deployment aligned with organizational values

**Visual concept options:**
1. **Three-column comparison:** "Current Training" (narrow, functional only) vs. "Functional Competencies" vs. "Critical Competencies" showing the gap
2. **Venn diagram:** Small circle (current training) inside larger overlapping circles (functional + critical competencies needed)
3. **T-shaped professional:** Vertical bar (functional depth) + horizontal bar (critical breadth) showing dual competency model

**Suggested caption:**
> *Figure 4: Current training provides surface-level tool awareness, but the industry demands dual competency: functional skills (deploy, interpret, select tools) paired with critical skills (evaluate claims, assess compliance, audit bias, advocate for values-aligned deployment).*

**Priority:** HIGH - provides actionable framework for what students need
