# Media Assessment for education.draft6.md

**Assessment Date:** December 31, 2025
**Context:** Tightened narrative focus on WHY critical literacy matters (not HOW the gap developed)

---

## Executive Summary

**Media Strategy:** 1 infographic (down from 3 in draft5)

**Rationale:** Draft6 focuses tightly on answering "Why is critical literacy important?" rather than providing exhaustive analysis of the education gap. Only media that directly supports this core question should remain.

---

## Infographic Decisions

### ✅ KEPT: Literacy Comparison

**File:** [literacy-comparison-1.webp](../visuals/literacy-comparison/literacy-comparison-1.webp)
**Placement:** After Line 71 (end of "Two Types of AI Literacy" section)
**Why kept:** Visualizes the core distinction between functional and critical AI literacy—the central concept answering the question.

**Caption:** *Figure 1: Functional AI literacy focuses on tool usage and "how/what" questions, while critical AI literacy addresses ethical evaluation through "why/who" questions and frameworks for assessing bias and power dynamics.*

**Supports narrative:** Directly illustrates the functional (what/how) vs. critical (why/who) framework that the entire section builds on.

---

### ❌ ARCHIVED: Academic Integration

**File:** academic-integration-4.webp (moved to archive/2025-12-31-draft6-revision/)
**Why archived:** Visualized detailed university program analysis (Surrey, Southern Cross, Penn State) that draft6 condensed to single paragraph. The "only 3 programs teach AI" finding is mentioned but not explored in depth.

**Draft6 treatment:** Lines 76-86 condense the academic gap to essential finding without detailed program enumeration.

**Decision:** Infographic designed for detailed analysis narrative no longer fits tighter scope.

---

### ❌ ARCHIVED: Skills Gap Cycle

**File:** skills-gap-cycle-3.webp (moved to archive/2025-12-31-draft6-revision/)
**Why archived:** Visualized vicious cycle explanation (universities can't keep up → industry trains in-house → graduates lack literacy → vendor-led training) that draft6 cut entirely.

**Draft6 treatment:** Removed detailed "Why Industry Outpaced Academia" and "Why Universities Lag" sections. The 71% skills gap statistic appears (Line 27) but without vicious cycle explanation.

**Decision:** Infographic designed to explain HOW the gap perpetuates, not WHY critical literacy matters. Cut.

---

### ❌ ARCHIVED: Curriculum Structure

**File:** curriculum-structure-3.webp (moved to archive/2025-12-31-draft6-revision/)
**Why archived:** Already removed in draft5. Visualized proposed 15-week curriculum that exceeded question scope.

**Draft6 treatment:** Not referenced. Focus on problem description, not prescriptive solutions.

**Decision:** Remains archived from draft5 revision.

---

## Narrative Flow Changes (draft5 → draft6)

**Sections CUT:**
- Detailed university program descriptions (Surrey, Southern Cross, Penn State deep dive)
- Professional certification pricing/content breakdown (MPI, PCMA details)
- University structural barriers explanation (12-24 month approvals, faculty hiring)
- Vicious cycle section (industry/university feedback loop)
- Recommendations section

**Sections CONDENSED:**
- Academic gap (Lines 76-86): Single section replacing 3 detailed program descriptions
- Industry certifications (Lines 48): One paragraph noting functional focus, not detailed breakdown

**Sections PRESERVED:**
- Opening question scenario (vendor 92% accuracy claim)
- Functional vs. Critical literacy definitions with festival examples
- Critical literacy void (real scenarios: vendor claims, hiring bias, dynamic pricing, facial recognition)
- What you need vs. what you're getting
- Bottom line call to action

**Word count:** ~2,900 (draft5) → ~2,050 (draft6)

**Infographic count:** 3 (draft5) → 1 (draft6)

## Summary

Draft6 refocuses on the core question: "Why is critical literacy important?" The literacy comparison infographic directly supports this by visualizing the functional/critical distinction. Other infographics explained the education gap's mechanics (how it developed, why it persists) rather than justifying critical literacy's importance.
