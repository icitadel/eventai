## Critical Issues (MUST FIX BEFORE PUBLICATION)

### ❌ Issue #1: Missing Source Attribution Blocks

**Problem:** Draft has **ZERO** source lists at end of sections

**Impact:** Academic integrity standards require source attribution; readers cannot verify claims

**Required Source Blocks (6 locations):**

1. **After line 71** (Two Types of AI Literacy section)
2. **After line 126** (State of Academic AI Integration section)
3. **After line 170** (Why Industry Has Outpaced Academia section)
4. **After line 231** (Critical Literacy Void section)
5. **After line 302** (71% Skills Gap section)
6. **After line 363** (Conclusion - comprehensive list)

**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

---

### ❌ Issue #2: Missing Visual Integration

**Problem:** Draft has **ZERO** references to 4 existing infographics

**Available Visuals:**
- VIS-2.1: literacy-comparison-6.webp (functional vs. critical)
- VIS-2.2: academic-integration-7.webp (barriers)
- VIS-2.4: curriculum-structure-6.webp (proposed course)
- VIS-2.3: skills-gap-cycle-3.webp (71% gap loop)

**Integration Points:**

1. **After line 71:** literacy-comparison-6.webp
2. **After line 126:** academic-integration-7.webp
3. **After line 289:** curriculum-structure-6.webp
4. **After line 302:** skills-gap-cycle-3.webp

**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

## High Priority Issues

### ⚠️ Issue #3: Cornell eCornell Pricing Verification

**Claim:** "$3,600" (line 50)

**Status:** Flagged in previous validation work as "NEEDS VERIFICATION"

**Action:** Verify current pricing or add qualifier "(2024 pricing)"

**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

---

### ⚠️ Issue #4: PCMA Pricing Not in Research Files

**Claim:** "$556-$695" (line 145)

**Status:** Not found in education research files

**Action:** Verify or remove specific pricing

**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

---

## Strengths
