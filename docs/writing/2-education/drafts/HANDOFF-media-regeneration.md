# Education Section: Media Regeneration Handoff

**Date:** December 31, 2025
**Context:** Draft6 narrative refocus complete, media needs reassessment required
**Status:** Ready for visual generation/evaluation phase

---

## Current State

**Active Draft:** [education.draft6.md](education.draft6.md)
- **Word count:** ~2,050 words (down from 2,900 in draft5)
- **Focus:** WHY critical literacy matters (not HOW the education gap developed)
- **Current media:** 1 infographic (literacy-comparison-1.webp)

**Archived Visuals:** [archive/2025-12-31-draft6-revision/](../visuals/archive/2025-12-31-draft6-revision/)
- academic-integration/ (detailed program analysis - no longer fits narrative)
- skills-gap-cycle/ (vicious cycle explanation - cut from draft)
- curriculum-structure/ (prescriptive curriculum - cut in draft5)

---

## Media Evaluation Questions

### Question 1: Does literacy-comparison still work for draft6?

**Current infographic:** [literacy-comparison-1.webp](../visuals/literacy-comparison/literacy-comparison-1.webp)

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does it visualize the functional (what/how) vs critical (why/who) distinction clearly?
- Does the visual support draft6's tighter narrative focus?
- Are the examples shown still relevant to the festival scenarios in draft6?
- Is the title issue from previous evaluations resolved? (embedded context requires no title)

**Action:** Review literacy-comparison-1.webp against draft6 narrative (Lines 35-71). If it still fits, keep. If not, regenerate.

---

### Question 2: Does draft6 need additional visuals?

**Narrative sections without visuals:**

1. **Critical Literacy Void (Lines 90-112):** Real scenarios showing consequences of lacking frameworks
   - Vendor claims accepted at face value → underperforming systems purchased
   - AI hiring tools deployed without bias audits → discrimination lawsuits
   - Dynamic pricing without ethical analysis → 91% fan opposition, regulatory investigations
   - Facial recognition without proportionality assessment → regulatory halts, wasted resources

   **Potential visual concept:** "Consequences of the Critical Literacy Gap" showing the cascade from lacking frameworks to documented failures (GDPR fines, wrongful arrests, failed ROI, public backlash)?

2. **What You Need vs. What You're Getting (Lines 114-131):** Dual competency framework
   - Functional skills (left): Deploy tools, interpret data, select applications
   - Critical skills (right): Evaluate vendor claims, assess compliance, audit bias, articulate trade-offs

   **Potential visual concept:** "Dual Competency Framework" showing the gap between what training provides (functional only) vs what's needed (functional + critical)?

**Evaluation approach:**
- Read draft6 completely
- Identify 1-2 concepts that would benefit most from visualization
- Consider: does the tighter narrative (2,050 words) need multiple visuals, or is single literacy-comparison sufficient?
- Prioritize visuals that directly answer "why critical literacy matters" rather than documenting gap mechanics

---

### Question 3: Title/Context Issue Status

**From previous evaluations:** All infographics had titles designed for STANDALONE context, but education section requires EMBEDDED context (no titles in images, context provided by figure captions).

**Check needed:**
- Does current literacy-comparison-1.webp have a title?
- If yes, regenerate without title
- If no, verify it's the correct "winner variant" from previous evaluation (variant #1, 92/100 score)

---

## Recommended Media Strategy

**Conservative approach (1 infographic):**
- Keep/regenerate literacy-comparison to visualize core functional vs critical distinction
- Rely on prose for consequences and dual competency framework
- Rationale: Tighter narrative (2,050 words) may not need extensive visual support

**Moderate approach (2 infographics):**
- literacy-comparison (core concept)
- consequences-of-gap OR dual-competency (whichever strengthens "why critical literacy matters" argument more)
- Rationale: Two visuals provide conceptual bookends (what critical literacy is → why it matters)

**Decision criteria:**
- Does the visual directly support answering "why is critical literacy important?"
- Would a student reading draft6 understand the argument without the visual? (If yes, visual is nice-to-have. If no, visual is essential.)

---

## Generation Workflow (if new visuals needed)

### Step 1: Concept Definition
For each new visual needed:
1. Extract data/concepts from draft6 narrative
2. Define visual purpose (what question does it answer?)
3. Write visual prompt following patterns from literacy-comparison, academic-integration, skills-gap-cycle
4. Specify EMBEDDED context (no title in image)

### Step 2: Batch Generation
- Generate 3-4 variants per concept using gemini-generate
- Follow concise mode from transformation visuals
- Target: 90%+ evaluation scores

### Step 3: Evaluation
- Use ig-evaluate.md pattern from previous visual evaluations
- Criteria: Data accuracy (MOST IMPORTANT), visual clarity, narrative support, embedded context appropriateness
- Select winner variant (90%+ score)

### Step 4: Integration
- Add to draft6 at appropriate locations
- Write BRIEF figure captions (1-2 sentences max)
- Verify narrative flow with visuals included

## Success Criteria

**Media regeneration complete when:**
- ✅ All infographics use EMBEDDED context (no titles in images)
- ✅ All visuals directly support "why critical literacy matters" question
- ✅ Figure captions are concise (1-2 sentences)
- ✅ Visual count aligns with narrative scope (1-2 for 2,050-word section)
- ✅ All evaluation scores 90%+ (data accuracy prioritized)
- ✅ Archived visuals documented in archive/2025-12-31-draft6-revision/

## Next Session TODO

1. **Evaluate existing media:**
   - [ ] Read education.draft6.md completely
   - [ ] Check if literacy-comparison-1.webp has title issue
   - [ ] Assess whether literacy-comparison still supports draft6 narrative

2. **Determine new media needs:**
   - [ ] Decide: 1 infographic (conservative) or 2 (moderate)?
   - [ ] If 2, which concept: consequences-of-gap or dual-competency framework?

3. **Generate/regenerate as needed:**
   - [ ] Regenerate literacy-comparison without title (if needed)
   - [ ] Generate new visual concepts (if pursuing moderate approach)
   - [ ] Batch generation: 3-4 variants per concept

4. **Evaluate and select:**
   - [ ] ig-evaluate.md for all new visuals
   - [ ] Select winners (90%+ scores, data accuracy prioritized)
   - [ ] Document decisions in evaluation reports

5. **Integrate:**
   - [ ] Add visuals to draft6 with brief captions
   - [ ] Verify narrative flow
   - [ ] Update draft6 status and word count

**Handoff complete.** Next session: evaluate → generate → integrate.
