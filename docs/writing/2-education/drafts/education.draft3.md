# Question 2: Critical AI Literacy in Education

> **For university students pursuing degrees in event management, why is learning about AI not just about using the tools (functional literacy), but also about understanding its ethical, economic, and philosophical implications (critical literacy)?**

**Context**: This question addresses the gap between AI tool proficiency and deeper critical understanding, examining why event management education must go beyond technical skills to include ethical reasoning, social justice dimensions, and systemic implications of AI deployment.

# Critical AI Literacy for Festival Professionals: The Education Gap

**Learning Objectives:**
After reading this section, you should be able to:
- Distinguish between functional AI literacy (tool use) and critical AI literacy (ethical evaluation)
- Identify the curriculum gap between industry AI adoption and academic preparation
- Evaluate whether professional certifications adequately substitute for degree-level AI education
- Assess the implications of graduating event professionals without critical frameworks for AI evaluation

## Introduction: The Professional Preparedness Crisis

A festival director choosing an AI crowd monitoring system faces questions no undergraduate event management program systematically prepares them to answer: *How do I evaluate vendor accuracy claims?* *What regulatory frameworks govern biometric data at festivals?* *How do I assess whether this AI perpetuates demographic bias?* *What happens when the algorithm fails and attendees are harmed?*

These are not hypothetical concerns—they are operational realities for festivals deploying AI in 2025. Yet research across 12 major universities in the US, UK, and Australia reveals that **only three programs explicitly integrate AI into hospitality curricula**, and **zero event management programs** offer dedicated AI literacy courses. Meanwhile, the industry races ahead: **71% of hospitality organizations report AI/robotics skills gaps**, and the sector is projected to grow from $1.8 billion to $14.2 billion by 2033.

The disconnect is stark: graduates enter an AI-saturated industry without frameworks to evaluate algorithmic systems, assess vendor claims, or navigate ethical dilemmas. This section examines the nature of this education gap, explores why industry professional development has outpaced universities, and argues that the near-total absence of **critical AI literacy**—the ability to question whose interests AI serves and who bears its costs—represents perhaps the most significant curriculum failure.

## Two Types of AI Literacy: Why the Distinction Matters

### Functional AI Literacy: Operating the Tools

**Definition:** "A set of competencies that enables individuals to critically evaluate AI technologies; communicate and collaborate effectively with AI; and use AI as a tool online, at home, and in the workplace" (Long & Magerko, 2020).

**Core Questions:** *How does AI work?* *What can AI do?* *Which tools should I use for this task?*

**Festival Applications:** Using ChatGPT to draft event descriptions or social media posts, operating predictive analytics dashboards for ticket sales forecasting, implementing chatbots for attendee customer service, and deploying AI-powered scheduling tools to optimize vendor placement.

Cornell eCornell's AI in Hospitality Certificate exemplifies this approach. The 5.5-day executive education program costs $3,600 and focuses entirely on *using* AI tools to accomplish tasks faster or more efficiently: ChatGPT for content creation, automation tools like Zapier and Botster for workflow efficiency, BigML for predictive modeling, and data visualization techniques. Graduates can operate specific platforms but may lack frameworks to evaluate whether deployment is appropriate, ethical, or aligned with organizational values.

---

### Critical AI Literacy: Questioning the Systems

**Core Questions:** *Whose interests does this AI serve?* *How does this system embed values?* *Who benefits and who bears costs?* *What are the unintended consequences?*

UNESCO's AI Competency Framework (2024) identifies three critical dimensions: ensuring AI enhances rather than replaces human judgment and creativity (human-centered mindset), understanding fairness, transparency, accountability, and bias (ethics of AI), and evaluating whether AI promotes inclusivity and equity or reinforces existing power structures (critical assessment).

Consider the festival applications. When a vendor proposes AI-driven dynamic pricing to increase ticket revenue by 20-30%, critical literacy asks: Does surge pricing exclude lower-income attendees? Does it undermine the festival's mission of accessibility? Who profits from price increases—organizers, shareholders, or artists? When security proposes opt-in facial entry to speed admission, the questions become: What happens to attendees who decline—are they penalized with longer waits? How is biometric data stored and who owns it? Does the system exhibit demographic bias? When a social media monitoring tool flags "concerning" attendee posts, who defines "concerning," and could this suppress legitimate criticism or activism?

The gap is fundamental: while functional AI literacy teaches *how to use* ChatGPT to write a festival schedule, critical AI literacy asks *whether AI-generated schedules prioritize sponsor visibility over attendee experience*.

## The Academic Void: Where Three Programs Stand Alone

The landscape is stark. Across 12 major universities in the US, UK, and Australia, only three programs explicitly integrate AI into hospitality curricula, and zero event management programs offer dedicated AI literacy courses.

University of Surrey represents the strongest integration found. Their BSc International Tourism/Hospitality/Event Management includes AI applications in MAN2220 Visitor Attraction Management—an optional module for event students covering VR, AR, and AI alongside ethics of technology deployment. The postgraduate core module MANM432 Smart Tourism and Events Design addresses big data analytics, smart tourism concepts, and IoT integration. Institutional commitment extends beyond coursework: Surrey's Centre for Digital Transformation in the Visitor Economy (DIGMY) lists "Artificial intelligence and robotics in hospitality, tourism, and events" as a core research theme, and the university has established a Senior Lecturer in AI and the Future of Work position. Yet even here, AI content is embedded within broader modules rather than standalone courses, and critical AI literacy receives minimal explicit attention beyond generic "ethical issues" mentions.

Southern Cross University takes a more operational approach. Their Bachelor of Business in Hotel Management requires HOTL3006 Hospitality Information and Technology Systems, which covers automation and robotics, data mining techniques, and guest-centric technologies. The learning outcome—"Critically analyse the role of management in digital information and technology systems"—suggests some critical thinking component, but no evidence exists of ethics-specific modules addressing algorithmic bias, surveillance implications, or power dynamics.

Penn State's Master of Professional Studies in Hospitality Management offers HM 830 Hospitality Data Analytics as a required graduate course, teaching predictive analytics, data visualization, and decision support systems. While predictive analytics inherently involves machine learning, the course does not explicitly frame content as "AI literacy." This reflects a broader pattern where data analytics courses teach AI techniques without addressing AI-specific ethical considerations or societal impacts.

For event management programs specifically, the gap widens to a void. Leeds Beckett University's UK Centre for Events Management—one of the largest dedicated programs globally—includes "websites and event technologies such as e-ticketing, QR codes, and RFID" but offers no AI, machine learning, or data analytics modules. Technology is "embedded" but not explicitly AI-focused. UCF Rosen College lists an HFT 3443 Event Technology course, but no documented AI content exists. While their Hospitality+ Center for Innovation announced an "AI-Enhanced Guest Services Lab," this remains research-level infrastructure, not integrated into degree requirements.

The implication is unavoidable: students graduating with event management degrees in 2025 receive zero systematic AI education specific to their discipline. They may take general university AI literacy courses—like the University of Florida's institution-wide requirement—but event-specific applications, ethical dilemmas, and industry case studies are absent.

## Why Industry Has Outpaced Academia

### Professional Certifications Fill the Gap (2023-2024)

While universities deliberate curriculum changes, professional organizations have moved with remarkable speed. Meeting Professionals International (MPI) launched their AI-Enhanced Event Professional Certificate in November 2023—barely a year after ChatGPT's release. Over 500 event planners have completed the 7.5 CMP clock hour program, which costs $305-$405 and covers AI concepts, chatbots, predictive analytics, AI-powered event management software, and personalized marketing. The classification is primarily functional AI literacy: using tools, not questioning their deployment.

The Professional Convention Management Association (PCMA) Institute offers a parallel Enhancing Events with AI Certificate taught by Nick Borelli, Zenus Director of Marketing. The program runs 7.5 CMP hours at $556-$695, covering AI platforms, marketing automation, audience engagement, logistics automation, and predictive analytics. PCMA's Project Spark platform, launched in May 2023, now serves over 3,000 event professionals who use generative AI for agenda development, content creation, and speaker biographies.

The contrast with university programs is instructive. MPI and PCMA launched certificates within months of ChatGPT's November 2022 release, while universities remain in planning stages as of 2025. The certifications cost $300-700 versus degree tuition, run in evenings and weekends versus semester-long commitments, and focus on industry-facing use cases like ChatGPT for event descriptions rather than theoretical foundations. Neither makes any pretense of covering ethics deeply—but then again, neither do most university programs that do exist.

### Why Universities Lag: Structural Barriers

The academic slowness isn't laziness—it's structural friction. New courses typically require 12-24 months for committee approvals, syllabus development, and faculty hiring. By the time a 2023 proposal becomes a 2025 course, AI tools have evolved multiple generations. Faculty in hospitality and event management were trained in operations, marketing, and human resources—not computer science or data ethics. Hiring AI-specialized faculty requires budget allocations and searches taking 1-2 years.

Accreditation constraints compound the problem. Hospitality programs must meet accreditor requirements covering operations, finance, HR, and marketing. Adding AI means reducing time for established content. And faculty promotion depends heavily on peer-reviewed research, not teaching innovation, creating misaligned incentives where developing new AI pedagogy counts less than publishing AI research papers.

The UK hospitality study finding that only 3% of organizations use higher education for digital training suggests curriculum relevance concerns have driven industry to self-provision through professional development rather than wait for universities to catch up.

## The Critical Literacy Void: What's Missing

Across all programs examined—university courses and professional certificates—critical AI literacy content is virtually absent. The implications cascade through the workforce.

Graduates learn how to read a vendor dashboard showing "92% prediction accuracy" but never ask: 92% accurate compared to what baseline? What counts as a "prediction"—a 5-minute window or 30-minute? Were test conditions representative of festival environments? Who funded the accuracy study—independent researchers or the vendor? They accept vendor metrics at face value, purchasing systems that underperform promises because they lack frameworks to evaluate evidence rigor.

They learn how to use AI recruitment tools to screen festival staff applications but don't question whether the algorithm penalizes résumés from candidates with non-traditional career paths, whether certain demographic groups are disproportionately filtered out, what training data was used, or who is liable when biased hiring results in discrimination lawsuits. Festival organizers deploy AI hiring tools without auditing for bias, perpetuating or amplifying existing inequities in the festival workforce—documented gender and racial disparities in live events employment.

They learn how to implement dynamic ticket pricing to "optimize revenue" without asking: Optimize for whom—the festival, artists, or attendees? Does surge pricing exclude lower-income fans, contradicting stated values of diversity and inclusion? Who profits from increased prices—ticket platforms, shareholders, or artists? What happens to festival culture when pricing algorithms treat attendance as pure market transaction? The result: 91% of UK fans oppose dynamic pricing, and regulatory investigations from UK Parliament to Australian ban proposals suggest public backlash against algorithmic pricing that graduates implementing these systems weren't prepared to anticipate.

They learn how to deploy facial recognition for faster festival entry without understanding whether biometric data processing is proportionate to the goal, what happens to attendees who decline, whether consent is genuinely voluntary or coercive, or what the long-term implications are of normalizing biometric surveillance at cultural events. The Danish Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) approved facial recognition for football matches—where documented violence exists—but explicitly denied it for concerts at the same venue. Graduates unaware of proportionality principles deploy systems that regulators halt, wasting resources and damaging trust.

---

## What Graduates Need vs. What They're Getting

Where AI training exists at all, typical graduates can use ChatGPT to draft event marketing copy, understand that predictive analytics can forecast attendance, know that AI chatbots can handle customer service inquiries, and are aware that RFID and facial recognition technologies exist. Yet they cannot evaluate whether a vendor's claimed "78% yield improvement" is credible, remain unaware of GDPR Article 9 requirements for biometric data processing, lack frameworks for assessing algorithmic bias in hiring or pricing systems, and struggle to articulate when human judgment should override AI recommendations.

What's needed instead is dual competency. Functionally, graduates should be able to deploy AI tools appropriately for content creation, scheduling, and analytics; interpret data visualizations and predictive model outputs; select appropriate AI applications for specific festival challenges; and troubleshoot common AI tool failures. Critically, they should be able to evaluate vendor claims using evidence-based frameworks with baseline comparisons, independent validation, and sample sizes; assess regulatory compliance for GDPR, BIPA, and CCPA when AI systems process personal data; audit AI systems for demographic bias and fairness; articulate ethical trade-offs between efficiency and privacy, personalization and filter bubbles, automation and employment; and advocate for responsible AI deployment that aligns with organizational values.

A semester-long course could address this gap. The first four weeks would cover AI fundamentals and festival applications: what is AI and machine learning in terms accessible to non-CS majors, festival use cases from crowd monitoring to dynamic pricing to personalization, and hands-on experience deploying a chatbot and analyzing attendance prediction models. Weeks five through eight would build critical evaluation frameworks: how to read academic papers, evaluate vendor studies, and identify conflicts of interest; the regulatory landscape of GDPR, BIPA, the EU AI Act, and FTC guidelines; and a case study like the Paris 2024 Olympics AI surveillance examining legal frameworks, CNIL oversight, and privacy by design.

Weeks nine through twelve would tackle ethical dilemmas and decision-making: algorithmic bias using the NIST facial recognition study, documented wrongful arrests, and audit methodologies; power and values with case studies like dynamic pricing backlash; and a student project conducting ethical assessment of a proposed AI system, such as evaluating a facial recognition vendor proposal using regulatory, technical, and values-based criteria. The final three weeks would incorporate industry perspectives and future trends through guest lectures from festival tech directors, privacy advocates, and AI vendors; a debate on questions like "Should festivals use facial recognition even with opt-in consent?"; and a final paper developing an AI deployment policy for a fictional festival that balances operational goals with ethical constraints.

## The 71% Skills Gap and Who Bears the Cost

A 2024 UK study found that 71% of hospitality organizations report AI/robotics skills gaps, yet only 3% use higher education for digital training. This creates a vicious cycle. Industry says: "Universities don't teach relevant AI skills, so we train in-house or hire external consultants." Universities respond: "Industry changes so fast we can't keep curricula current, and our faculty lack AI expertise." The consequence falls on graduates: entry-level festival professionals lack both functional skills for operating AI tools and critical frameworks for evaluating ethical implications, forcing them to learn on the job—often from vendors with incentives to oversell capabilities and downplay risks.

The societal consequence extends beyond individual careers. AI systems are deployed at festivals without adequate oversight because decision-makers lack training to recognize when deployment is inappropriate, non-compliant, or harmful. The documented failures suggest that skills gaps have real consequences: €200,000 in GDPR fines for events deploying biometric systems without adequate data protection impact assessments, wrongful arrests via facial recognition, and 42% of organizations reporting zero ROI on AI investments—often because tools were deployed without understanding limitations or fit.

## Recommendations: Closing the Gap

### For Universities (Short-Term: 1-2 Years)

Universities waiting to launch standalone AI programs are missing opportunities for immediate integration. Embed AI modules in existing courses rather than creating new ones: Event Technology courses can add 2-3 weeks on AI applications, ethics, and regulation; Marketing courses can integrate AI content creation, personalization ethics, and algorithmic curation; Operations courses can cover predictive analytics, workforce optimization, and bias auditing.

Partner with industry for guest lectures and case studies. Bring festival tech directors, privacy advocates, and AI vendors into classrooms to provide current perspectives. This addresses the relevance gap without waiting for faculty hires. Develop assessment rubrics for critical thinking that require students to evaluate vendor proposals, audit AI systems for bias, or develop ethical deployment policies as capstone projects.

---

### For Universities (Long-Term: 3-5 Years)

Hire AI-specialized faculty or cross-list with computer science departments. Joint appointments between hospitality and CS bring technical expertise while maintaining industry context. Develop dedicated "AI in Events" courses as semester-long offerings covering technical foundations, festival applications, regulatory frameworks, and ethical decision-making.

Create industry-academic partnerships for curriculum development. Collaborate with MPI, PCMA, and major festivals to ensure content relevance and secure guest lecturers and internship hosts. This bridges the relevance gap that currently drives organizations away from higher education for digital training.

---

### For Professional Organizations

Expand certifications to include critical literacy. Current MPI and PCMA programs focus on functional skills—add modules on bias auditing, regulatory compliance, and ethical frameworks. Develop case study libraries documenting real festival AI deployments with financial data, regulatory outcomes, and lessons learned to provide evidence-based learning rather than vendor-curated success stories.

Offer AI ethics workshops separate from tool-use training. Provide sessions on GDPR compliance, proportionality testing, consent architecture, and algorithmic accountability that professionals can take regardless of their functional AI skill level.

---

### For Festival Organizations

Don't assume AI vendors provide adequate training. Vendor-led training focuses on their product, not critical evaluation or comparison to alternatives. Invest in staff development by sending team members to MPI and PCMA certifications, subscribing to industry publications covering AI developments, and creating internal learning communities.

Build relationships with universities by offering guest lecture opportunities, internships, or capstone project partnerships. This shapes curriculum while accessing emerging talent, creating a feedback loop that benefits both education and industry.

## Conclusion: The Cost of Graduating AI-Illiterate Professionals

The current state—event management graduates entering an AI-saturated industry without systematic AI education—is unsustainable. Functional AI literacy is necessary but insufficient. Without critical AI literacy—the ability to question vendor claims, assess bias, evaluate proportionality, and advocate for values-aligned deployment—graduates become conduits for uncritical technology adoption rather than thoughtful decision-makers.

The evidence suggests this is not hypothetical risk. Forty-two percent of organizations report zero ROI from AI investments, often because tools were deployed without understanding limitations or fit. Events have incurred €200,000 in GDPR fines for deploying biometric systems without adequate legal analysis. Festival organizers initially failed to anticipate public resistance to facial recognition and dynamic pricing, leading to 91% of UK fans opposing algorithmic ticket pricing and regulatory investigations across multiple countries.

For students entering the festival industry, the question is not whether they will encounter AI—it's whether they will have frameworks to deploy it responsibly. The current education landscape provides a clear answer: they will not, unless universities and professional organizations urgently prioritize critical AI literacy alongside functional skills.

The choice facing hospitality and event management education is stark: evolve curricula to prepare graduates for an AI-shaped industry, or continue producing professionals who lack the competencies their employers desperately need and society increasingly demands.
