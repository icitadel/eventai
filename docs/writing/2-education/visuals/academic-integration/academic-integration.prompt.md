# Academic AI Integration Disparity

## Visual Type
Conceptual disparity diagram | Landscape | NOT literal geographic map

## Layout
Center: 3 lit-up universities | Surrounding: Many darkened universities | Top: "3/100+ = 3% coverage"

## The 3 Universities WITH AI (Highlighted - Purple #6B46C1 + Coral #FF6B6B)

**University of Surrey (UK)**: VR/AR/AI in Visitor Attraction Management (postgrad)
**Southern Cross (Australia)**: Automation/Robotics in Hotel Management (undergrad)
**Penn State (US)**: Data Analytics in Hospitality (undergrad/grad)

## Event Programs WITHOUT AI (Faded - Gray)

**Leeds Beckett UKCEM**: UK premier event program, ZERO AI modules
**UCF Rosen**: Top US hospitality program, ZERO AI content
**100+ other programs**: No documented AI integration

## The Gap Stats (Coral #FF6B6B Callouts)

- **3/100+ programs = 3% coverage**
- **97% teach ZERO AI content**
- **71% professionals lack AI skills**
- **Zero event-specific AI programs**

## The Vicious Cycle (Bottom/Side)

1. Universities: "Too fast, can't keep up"
2. Industry: "Universities don't teach, we train in-house"
3. Graduates: No functional/critical literacy
4. Training: Vendor-led (overselling incentive)
5. Result: 42% zero ROI, fines, failures

## Design Requirements

**CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS (90% Quality Target)**:
- **White space: 35-40%** of composition (NOT just 30% minimum!)
- **Isometric buildings with interior detail** showing hospitality/event education (PROVEN SUCCESSFUL in top variants)
- **Vicious cycle icons: 56-64px minimum** (NOT 48px - too small for visual balance)
- **All text ≥14pt minimum** (cycle text, university labels, etc.)

**Colors**:
- WITH AI: Deep purple #6B46C1, Electric coral #FF6B6B (glowing/prominent)
- WITHOUT AI: Light gray #E2E8F0 (faded/inactive)
- Stats: Electric coral #FF6B6B
- Text: Midnight slate #2D3748
- Background: Pure white #FFFFFF

**Visual Style**:
- **ISOMETRIC university buildings with interior activity** (NOT flat icons, NOT generic buildings)
- Show people/activity inside buildings (event/hospitality education context)
- Brightness contrast: 3 glowing vs many faded
- Festival/event context visible inside buildings
- Semi-flat with subtle depth
- Professional + energetic mood

**Typography** (90% STANDARD):
- Headers: Inter bold 24-36pt
- Subtitle: 16-18pt (NOT 14pt!)
- University names: Source Sans Pro 14-16pt minimum
- Stats: Inter bold 48-72pt
- Cycle text: Source Sans Pro 14-16pt (NOT 12pt!)

**Key Elements**:
- 3 prominent isometric buildings (named, lit up, interior detail visible)
- ~15-20 faded background institutions (unnamed silhouettes)
- "3% coverage" prominently displayed
- Vicious cycle with 56-64px icons and 14-16pt text
- Generous margins: 64px all sides
- White space 35-40%

**NOT**:
- NO literal geographic map
- NO generic academic imagery (graduation caps, books)
- NO boring institutional style
- Use event/festival context where possible
