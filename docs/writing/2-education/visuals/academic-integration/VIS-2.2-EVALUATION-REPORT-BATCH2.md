   - Impact: Ensures maximum accessibility
   - Priority: 🟢 Low (high confidence it will pass, but verification recommended)

2. **CMYK print test** (if professional printing intended)
   - Current: RGB color space
   - Recommended: Test color shifts in CMYK conversion
   - Impact: Ensures purple/coral colors print accurately
   - Priority: 🟢 Low (only if high-quality printing planned)

### Low Priority (Optional Polish)

3. **Increase subtitle to 18pt** (currently 16pt)
   - Current: 16pt (meets 14pt+ requirement)
   - Optional: Increase to 18pt for extra readability
   - Impact: Marginal improvement
   - Priority: 🟢 Very Low (not needed, current size fine)
