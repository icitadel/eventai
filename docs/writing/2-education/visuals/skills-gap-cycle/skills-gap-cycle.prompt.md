# The 71% Skills Gap Cycle

## Visual Type
Circular flow infographic | Square orientation | Festival/event management context

## Layout
Five-stage circular cycle with center callout:
1. Industry: "Universities don't teach AI, we train in-house"
2. University: "Industry changes too fast, we can't keep up"
3. Graduates: Lack functional AND critical AI literacy
4. Vendor Training: On-the-job learning (incentivized to oversell)
5. Failures: 42% zero ROI, GDPR fines, wrongful arrests

Center: "The Paradox"—arrows showing reinforcement loop

## Stage 1: Industry Decision (Purple #6B46C1)

**Headline**: "Universities Don't Teach AI, We Train In-House"

**Details**:
- Universities can't keep pace with rapid change
- Curriculum approval: 18-24 months
- Industry decision: "Easier to hire and retrain ourselves"
- No demand signal sent to universities
- Example: 62% of event companies train AI staff internally only

## Stage 2: University Constraint (Purple #6B46C1)

**Headline**: "Industry Changes Too Fast, We Can't Keep Up"

**Details**:
- Curriculum approval cycles: 18-24 months
- Faculty hiring: Need scarce AI PhDs
- No funding for new programs
- No industry demand (from Stage 1)
- Result: 0% of UK event management programs include AI

## Stage 3: Graduate Deficit (Purple #6B46C1)

**Headline**: "Graduates Lack Functional AND Critical AI Literacy"

**Details**:
- No tool experience from degree
- No critical evaluation frameworks
- 71% of event professionals can't assess vendor claims
- Graduates enter workforce unprepared
- Reactive learning forced by job necessity

## Stage 4: Vendor Training (Coral #FF6B6B)

**Headline**: "On-the-Job Learning (Incentivized to Oversell)"

**Details**:
- Knowledge source: Vendor sales reps
- Training: Free, promotional, sales-focused
- Framework: "How to use our tool" not "How to evaluate tools"
- Example: Dynamic pricing training teaches revenue maximization, not ethics
- 100% of initial vendor training is sales-focused

## Stage 5: Failures (Coral #FF6B6B)

**Headline**: "42% Zero ROI | GDPR Fines | Wrongful Arrests"

**Details**:
- 42% of AI deployments produce zero ROI
- Facial recognition misidentification (high error rates for certain groups)
- Dynamic pricing discrimination lawsuits
- GDPR violations and data privacy breaches
- Vendor-trained professionals lack critical thinking to prevent failures

## Central Callout: The Paradox (Blue #4299E1)

**Key Insight**:
- Industry: "Universities aren't teaching this"
- Universities: "Industry isn't demanding this"
- Both rational decisions create irrational outcome
- Cycle reinforces itself
- Breaking it requires CRITICAL AI LITERACY

## Key Statistics

**Prominently Display**:
- **71%** - Skills gap (event professionals lacking critical literacy)
- **42%** - Zero ROI from AI investments
- **0%** - UK event management programs with AI curriculum
- **3%** - Global hospitality/event programs with AI (3 out of 100+)
- **18-24 months** - University curriculum approval cycle
- **100%** - Initial vendor training is sales-focused

## Design Requirements

**Colors**:
- Purple: #6B46C1 (cycle flow, decision stages)
- Coral: #FF6B6B (failures, problems, urgency)
- Blue: #4299E1 (central insight, solution opportunity)
- Text: Midnight slate #2D3748
- Background: Pure white #FFFFFF

**Typography**:
- Headers (stages): Inter bold 28-32pt
- Headlines (each stage): Inter bold 20-24pt
- Details: Source Sans Pro 13-15pt
- Key stat (71%): Inter bold 64-72pt
- Other stats: Inter bold 32-48pt

**Style**:
- Circular flow diagram with clear arrows showing cycle direction
- Festival context icons ONLY: crowd lines, event stages, wristbands, mobile apps, venue maps, ticket scanners
- NO generic corporate icons (gears, money bags, lightbulbs)
- Semi-flat with subtle depth and shadows
- Rounded corners 8-12px on all elements
- 2-3px border strokes for clarity
- High data-ink ratio
- Professional + energetic mood
- White space ≥30%
- Center callout visually prominent, separate from cycle

**Layout Specifics**:
- Square aspect ratio (optimized for portrait displays/social media)
- Five segments arranged in circle around center callout
- Clear circular arrows showing reinforcement loop
- Each stage clearly labeled and color-coded
- Failure stage (Stage 5) visually distinct with coral color
- Central paradox box connects all stages conceptually

**Festival Context Imagery**:
- Stage representations: Event venue/auditorium elements
- Crowd elements: Diverse attendees, staff badges
- Technology touchpoints: Mobile event apps, facial recognition cameras, dynamic pricing displays
- Real-world consequences: Concerned faces for failures, collaborative hands for solutions
- Event-specific: Wristbands, schedule displays, sponsor booths, crowd flow

**Accessibility**:
- Text readable at 13-15pt minimum
- WCAG AA contrast ratios met
- Not color-dependent (labels + icons clarify meaning)
- Circular flow clear without relying on color alone
- High contrast between purple background elements and white space

## Festival/Event Context
