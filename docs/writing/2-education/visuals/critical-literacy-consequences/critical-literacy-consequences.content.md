# VIS-2.3: Consequences of the Critical Literacy Void

**Infographic Purpose**: Visualize the documented cascade from lacking critical frameworks to real-world failures in festival/event AI deployment. Answers "Why does critical literacy matter?"

---

## Four Documented Failure Paths

### Path 1: Vendor Claims Without Evaluation

**Lacking Framework**:
- No vendor claim evaluation methods
- No baseline comparison protocols
- No independent validation requirements
- No sample size assessment standards

**Uncritical Deployment**:
- Accept "92% accuracy" claims at face value
- Purchase systems based on vendor-provided metrics only
- No evidence rigor assessment
- No representative test condition verification

**Documented Consequences**:
- **42%** of organizations report **zero ROI** from AI investments (McKinsey State of AI 2025)
- Underperforming systems purchased
- Failed to meet promised efficiency gains
- Wasted resources on tools that don't deliver

---

### Path 2: Bias Auditing Without Protocols

**Lacking Framework**:
- No bias auditing protocols
- No demographic testing requirements
- No training data analysis standards
- No liability assessment for discriminatory outcomes

**Uncritical Deployment**:
- AI recruitment tools deployed to screen festival staff applications
- No testing for demographic bias
- No examination of training data sources
- No assessment of non-traditional career path penalties

**Documented Consequences**:
- Discrimination lawsuits when biased hiring exposed
- Perpetuated inequities in festival workforce
- Certain demographic groups disproportionately filtered out
- Legal liability for algorithmic discrimination

---

### Path 3: Ethical Analysis Without Frameworks

**Lacking Framework**:
- No ethical analysis frameworks
- No stakeholder impact assessment methods
- No values-alignment evaluation protocols
- No consideration of who profits vs. who pays

**Uncritical Deployment**:
- Dynamic ticket pricing deployed for "revenue optimization"
- No assessment of accessibility impacts
- No analysis of contradiction with diversity/inclusion missions
- No evaluation of cultural implications (attendance as market transaction)

**Documented Consequences**:
- **91%** of UK fans oppose dynamic pricing (Music Fans' Voice Survey via MusicRadar)
- Regulatory investigations:
  - UK Parliament inquiry into algorithmic ticket pricing
  - Australian proposals to ban dynamic pricing
- Public backlash against festivals implementing surge pricing
- Lower-income attendees excluded from events
- Festival culture damaged by treating attendance as pure market transaction

---

### Path 4: Proportionality Without Principles

**Lacking Framework**:
- No proportionality assessment principles
- No biometric data processing standards
- No consent voluntariness evaluation
- No long-term surveillance implications analysis

**Uncritical Deployment**:
- Facial recognition deployed for festival entry to "speed admission"
- No assessment of whether biometric processing is proportionate to goal
- No evaluation of what happens to attendees who decline
- No analysis of demographic bias in recognition accuracy
- No consideration of normalizing biometric surveillance at cultural events

**Documented Consequences**:
- **€200,000 GDPR fine** for Mobile World Congress 2021 facial recognition (GSMA fine, TechCrunch coverage)
- Regulatory halts by data protection authorities
- Danish Data Protection Authority example:
  - Approved facial recognition for football matches (documented violence risk)
  - Denied facial recognition for concerts at same venue (disproportionate)
- Wasted resources on systems regulators stop
- Damaged attendee trust in festival organizations

## The Pattern

**For Each Path**:
1. **No Critical Framework** → Event professionals lack structured methods to evaluate AI systems
2. **Uncritical Deployment** → Systems deployed without ethical, legal, or evidence-based scrutiny
3. **Documented Failures** → Real consequences with specific data points (42% zero ROI, 91% opposition, €200K fines)

**Central Argument**: Critical literacy void leads directly to measurable, documented failures in the festival industry.

## Key Statistics to Highlight

- **42%** zero ROI from AI investments (McKinsey 2025)
- **91%** UK fan opposition to dynamic pricing
- **€200,000** GDPR fine (GSMA MWC 2021)
- **4 distinct failure paths** (vendor claims, bias, ethics, proportionality)

---

## Visual Design Notes

**Layout**: Four horizontal flow paths (landscape orientation)
- Each path flows left → center → right
- Clear visual separation between paths (different colors)
- Arrows showing causation

**Path Color Coding**:
- Path 1 (Vendor): Sky blue #4299E1
- Path 2 (Bias): Deep purple #6B46C1
- Path 3 (Ethics): Electric coral #FF6B6B
- Path 4 (Proportionality): Emerald green #10B981

**Key Visual Elements**:
- Festival context icons: tickets, vendor booths, entry gates, crowds, facial recognition cameras
- Bold statistics: 42%, 91%, €200K
- Flow arrows showing cascade effect
- Professional + whimsy style (EventAI brand)

**Context**: EMBEDDED (no title on infographic, title in figure caption)
- Caption will provide context
- Visual must be data-focused, minimal explanatory text
- Clean design that integrates with surrounding narrative
