# VIS-2.2: Academic AI Integration Map

**Infographic Purpose**: Show the stark disparity between the 3 universities WITH AI integration vs. hundreds WITHOUT in hospitality/event management education.

## The 3% Reality

### Universities WITH AI Integration (3 out of 100+)

**University of Surrey (UK)**:
- Program: VR/AR/AI in Visitor Attraction Management
- Content: Immersive technologies module
- Level: Postgraduate specialization

**Southern Cross University (Australia)**:
- Program: Automation/Robotics in Hotel Management
- Content: AI applications in hospitality operations
- Level: Undergraduate elective

**Penn State University (US)**:
- Program: Data Analytics in Hospitality
- Content: AI-powered analytics for revenue management
- Level: Undergraduate/Graduate

---

### Event Management Programs WITHOUT AI (97%)

**Leeds Beckett University (UKCEM)**:
- UK's premier event management program
- **ZERO** AI modules documented
- Focus: Traditional event planning, logistics, marketing

**University of Central Florida (Rosen)**:
- Top US hospitality program
- **ZERO** documented AI content in event management track
- Focus: Operations, finance, traditional management

**Hundreds of other programs worldwide**: No documented AI integration

---

## The Coverage Gap

**Statistics**:
- **3 out of 100+** hospitality/event programs = **3% coverage**
- **97%** of programs teach ZERO AI content
- **71%** of event professionals report lacking AI skills
- **Zero** event-specific AI literacy programs exist

**What's Missing**:
- Functional AI literacy (tool usage)
- Critical AI literacy (evaluation frameworks)
- Regulatory knowledge (GDPR, EU AI Act)
- Ethical assessment capabilities
- Vendor claim evaluation skills

---

## Why This Matters

### The Vicious Cycle:
1. **Universities**: "Industry changes too fast, we can't keep up"
2. **Industry**: "Universities don't teach AI, we train in-house"
3. **Graduates**: Lack functional AND critical literacy
4. **On-the-job training**: From vendors (incentivized to oversell)
5. **Result**: 42% zero ROI, GDPR fines, wrongful arrests

### Real-World Consequences:
- Professionals can't evaluate vendor claims
- No framework for assessing ROI evidence
- Lack regulatory compliance knowledge
- Unable to identify ethical issues
- Default to "vendor knows best" approach

## Visual Design Notes

**Layout**: Conceptual diagram (NOT literal geographic map)
- 3 lit-up/highlighted institutions (WITH AI)
- Many darkened/faded institutions (WITHOUT AI)
- Stat callout: "3/100+ = 3% coverage"

**Visual Approach**:
- Use stylized building/university icons
- Highlight disparity through color/brightness contrast
- Festival professional + whimsy style (NOT academic/boring)
- Show global distribution (UK, US, Australia) but not literal map

**Key Stats to Highlight**:
- 3 universities WITH AI
- 100+ universities WITHOUT AI
- 3% coverage rate
- 71% skills gap
- 97% teach ZERO AI content

**Color Guidance**:
- Lit-up universities: Deep purple (#6B46C1) + Electric coral (#FF6B6B) - innovative, leading
- Darkened universities: Light gray - inactive, traditional
- Stats callout: Electric coral (#FF6B6B) - urgency

**Festival Context**:
- Use event management imagery (not generic academic)
- Show connection between education gap and industry failures
- Professional + energetic mood
