### Module 2: Critical Evaluation (Weeks 5-8)

**Core Concept**: Evaluating AI systems critically, understanding regulatory frameworks, learning from real-world cases

**Week 5-6: Evidence Assessment and Vendor Claims**
- How to read AI research papers vs. marketing whitepapers
- The difference between "statistically significant" and "practically useful"
- Common misleading metrics: accuracy ≠ fairness, correlation ≠ causation
- Evaluating vendor ROI claims with skepticism framework
- Case study: Examining claimed "40% efficiency gains" in event logistics

**Week 7: Regulatory Landscape**
- **GDPR requirements** for AI systems handling attendee data
  - Data minimization: what data collection is necessary?
  - Consent architecture: how to ask attendees permission
  - Right to be forgotten: festival records management
- **EU AI Act** compliance (high-risk, limited-risk, low-risk categories)
  - Facial recognition systems at entry gates = HIGH RISK
  - Recommendation algorithms = LIMITED RISK
- **Other frameworks**: California CCPA, UK Online Safety Bill
- Real compliance costs and legal exposure

**Week 8: Case Study Deep Dive - Paris 2024 Olympic Games**
- **Deliverable 2**: Analyze Paris 2024's use of AI facial recognition
  - Expected system: scanning 180,000 faces per event during games
  - Stated purpose: Security enhancement
  - Ethical concerns: Accuracy rates, bias toward certain populations, impact on privacy
- Research assignment: Identify potential GDPR violations
- Debate prep: Is the trade-off justified?

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Assess evidence quality and vendor claims critically
- Understand regulatory obligations
- Apply frameworks to real-world systems

---

### Module 3: Ethical Dilemmas (Weeks 9-12)

**Core Concept**: Grappling with complex ethical questions, recognizing power dynamics, developing assessment frameworks

**Week 9-10: Algorithmic Bias and Fairness**
- **Foundational case**: NIST study on facial recognition bias
  - False positive rates vary by demographic group
  - Technology vendors had highest error rates on Asian and Black faces
  - Implications: Who gets wrongly identified as a security risk at your festival?
- Types of bias in AI: Training data bias, algorithmic bias, feedback loops
- Examples in event context:
  - Recommendation algorithm that suppresses diverse artists
  - Dynamic pricing that charges more to certain demographic groups
  - Chatbot that responds differently based on language/dialect

**Week 11: Power, Values, and Real-World Backlash**
- **Case study**: Uber's dynamic pricing and public backlash
  - During emergencies/high-demand events, prices skyrocket
  - Customers perceived this as "price gouging"
  - Public outrage and regulatory scrutiny followed
- Transferred to festivals:
  - If your dynamic pricing algorithm charges more during peak hours, who is priced out?
  - Does this contradict your stated values of accessibility?
  - What's the difference between "surge pricing" (acceptable) and "exploitation" (unacceptable)?
- Ethics frameworks: Utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics applied to event systems

**Week 12: Student Project - Ethical Assessment Framework**
- **Deliverable 3**: Develop an AI ethical assessment framework for festivals
- Assess a proposed AI system (chosen by student):
  - Could be: recommendation algorithm, facial recognition, chatbot, pricing system, accessibility tool
  - Apply ethical lenses: Who benefits? Who is harmed? What are the power dynamics?
  - Identify potential biases and mitigation strategies
  - Propose guardrails and monitoring approaches
  - Present to class: 15-minute presentation of assessment

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Recognize biases in data and algorithms
- Understand power dynamics and values conflicts
- Develop practical ethical assessment skills

### Module 4: Industry Perspectives and Policy (Weeks 13-15)

**Core Concept**: Hearing from practitioners, debating real decisions, synthesizing learning into actionable policy

**Week 13: Guest Lectures and Industry Perspectives**
- **Speaker 1**: Event tech vendor (CEO or product lead)
  - What AI does their platform use? Why?
  - What claims do they make about ROI?
- **Speaker 2**: Festival operations manager (Glastonbury, Coachella, or similar)
  - How do they currently use AI? What worked? What didn't?
  - What ethical concerns have come up?
- **Speaker 3**: Regulatory/legal expert
  - Recent GDPR fines (from non-event industries applicable to events)
  - What compliance failures look like in practice

**Week 14: Capstone Debate - Facial Recognition at Festivals**
- **Deliverable 4A**: Debate preparation and participation
- Proposition: "Large festivals should deploy facial recognition systems at gates for security purposes"
- Teams: For and Against
- Requirements:
  - Evidence-based arguments (cite research, regulations, case studies)
  - Address vendor claims critically
  - Consider security benefits vs. privacy harms
  - Acknowledge trade-offs, don't oversimplify
- Post-debate: Reflect on how actual event managers would decide this

**Week 15: Final Paper - AI Deployment Policy**
- **Deliverable 4B**: Individual policy paper
- Prompt: "Design an AI governance policy for a major music festival (attendance: 50,000+)"
- Requirements:
  - Identify 1-2 specific AI systems the festival might adopt
  - Apply critical evaluation frameworks: evidence assessment, regulatory compliance, ethical assessment
  - Propose governance structure: Who decides? How is risk managed?
  - Include guardrails: What would you monitor? What would trigger stopping an AI system?
  - Length: 3,000-4,000 words
  - Draw on all 14 prior weeks of learning

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Hear from diverse industry perspectives
- Engage in structured debate on real issues
- Synthesize learning into actionable organizational policy

## Learning Progression

### Three-Stage Arc:

1. **Understanding (Weeks 1-4)**: What is AI? How does it work? What can it do?
2. **Evaluation (Weeks 5-12)**: How do we assess claims? What are the rules? What are the ethical issues?
3. **Decision-Making (Weeks 13-15)**: What should WE do? How do we decide? What policies should guide us?

### Functional + Critical Together:

- **Functional literacy** embedded throughout (Week 4 chatbot, understanding how systems work)
- **Critical literacy** deepens progressively (Evidence → Regulation → Ethics → Policy)
- Real-world applications in every module
