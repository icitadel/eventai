## Overview

Create an infographic showing a complete 15-week AI literacy curriculum for event management professionals. The design should show progressive learning from foundational concepts to policy-level decision making. Display as a vertical flow/timeline moving from top to bottom.

## Design Requirements

### Colors (Progressive Deepening):
- **Module 1 (Fundamentals)**: Sky blue #4299E1 - practical, approachable
- **Module 2 (Evaluation)**: Teal #17A2B8 - analytical, deeper
- **Module 3 (Ethics)**: Deep purple #6B46C1 - complex, thoughtful
- **Module 4 (Policy)**: Coral #FF6B6B - decisive, actionable
- **Text**: Midnight slate #2D3748 (high contrast, readable)
- **Background**: Pure white #FFFFFF (clean, professional)
- **Accent/connectors**: Light gray #E2E8F0 for visual flow lines

### Typography:
- **Module headers**: Inter bold 28-32pt (large, clear hierarchy)
- **Week numbers**: Inter bold 20-24pt (visible, distinct)
- **Topic titles**: Source Sans Pro 16-18pt bold (secondary headers)
- **Content text**: Source Sans Pro 12-14pt (readable without squinting)
- **Deliverable callouts**: Inter bold 14-16pt (emphasis for major projects)

### Layout & Spacing:
- **Portrait orientation** (taller than wide, ~9:16 or 3:5 ratio)
- **Vertical flow**: Modules stack from top to bottom
- **White space**: ≥30% (NOT cramped, NOT busy)
- **Rounded corners**: 8-12px on module cards/boxes
- **Subtle depth**: Semi-flat style with light shadows (not 3D overdone)
- **Visual connectors**: Flow lines or subtle arrows showing progression between modules
- **Week numbers left margin**: Small, aligned left, consistent spacing
- **Module color bars**: Vertical bar on left of each module showing color theme

### Visual Style:
- **Festival context ONLY**: Stages, crowds, security gates, event apps, wristbands, headsets
- **NO generic corporate imagery**: No gears, lightbulbs, money bags, handshake icons, charts
- **Professional + energetic**: Not boring academic, not cartoonish
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA contrast ratios, text sizes 12pt minimum, icons supplemented with labels
- **High data-ink ratio**: Every element serves a purpose

### Information Density:
- Module headers + week ranges + key topics + deliverables + learning stage callouts
- Avoid: Over-detail, lecture notes, full sentences (use bullet points/short phrases)
- Balance: Information necessary for understanding vs. clean visual presentation

## What NOT to Include

❌ Generic business imagery (gears, money bags, lightbulbs, handshakes)
❌ Academic stereotypes (graduation caps, books, chalkboards)
❌ Beige/cream background (pure white only)
❌ Muddy or unclear color differentiation between modules
❌ Text smaller than 12pt
❌ Cramped layout (need breathing room)
❌ Literal geographic map or pins
❌ Overly technical AI diagrams or neural networks
❌ Sad/serious tone (it's educational but should be engaging)

---

## Festival/Event Management Context

Throughout the design, reinforce that this is FOR event professionals:
- Mention festival names where relevant (Coachella, Glastonbury, Tomorrowland, Paris 2024)
- Use event-specific icons and imagery
- Show real-world applications in every module
- Make it clear: This isn't abstract computer science, it's decision-making that affects real festivals and attendees
