# Dual Competency Framework - Infographic Evaluation

**Generation Date:** December 31, 2025
**Density Tier:** CONCISE (40%+ white space, minimal text, category names only)
**Context:** EMBEDDED (textbook curriculum - no centered title expected)
**CLI Status:** Sequential submission → All variants got unique URLs ✅

---

## Batch 1 Evaluation: CONCISE Variants (1-3)

**Context Check:**
- ✅ EMBEDDED context identified (location: `/docs/writing/2-education/visuals/`)
- ✅ NO centered title expected (title will be in figure caption)
- ✅ CONCISE tier: Category names only, no explanatory paragraphs
- ✅ 40%+ white space target

---

### Variant 1: Festival Theme with Stats Integration

**Visual Design:**
- Three columns: CURRENT TRAINING (gray), FUNCTIONAL COMPETENCIES (blue), CRITICAL COMPETENCIES (purple)
- Bridge/festival imagery at top
- Red "GAP" arrows showing "CURRENT ≠ NEEDED" and "DUAL COMPETENCY NEEDED"
- Stats integrated: 71% Skills Gap, 3/100 Programs highlighted
- Icons for each competency

**Content Accuracy:**
- ✅ Current: Tool awareness, No evaluation skills, No critical frameworks
- ✅ Functional: Deploy AI tools, Interpret outputs, Select applications, Troubleshoot failures
- ✅ Critical: Evaluate claims, Assess compliance, Audit for bias, Articulate trade-offs, Advocate responsibly
- ✅ Stats: 71% skills gap, 3/100 programs ✅

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Three-column layout clearly shows gap (narrow → medium → wide)
- ✅ Festival context with bridge imagery
- ✅ GAP arrows reinforce message
- ✅ Color scheme correct (gray, blue, purple)
- ✅ Icons for each category

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **CRITICAL: HAS CENTERED TITLE** - "DUAL COMPETENCY FRAMEWORK: WHAT YOU NEED VS. WHAT YOU'RE GETTING" violates embedded context requirements
- ⚠️ Text density moderate (not minimal as CONCISE requires)
- ⚠️ White space ~30-35% (below 40% target)
- ⚠️ "OPERATIONAL PROFICIENCY" / "ANALYTICAL PROFICIENCY" labels add text cruft

**Estimated Score:** 76/100 - Fair (title violation is critical issue)
**Recommendation:** Cannot use - embedded context requires NO title

### Variant 2: Clean Three-Column Layout ⭐⭐ BEST VARIANT

**Visual Design:**
- Three distinct rounded rectangles: Gray (narrow), Blue (medium), Purple (wide)
- Central red GAP arrow
- Clean section headers: "CURRENT TRAINING (Narrow)", "FUNCTIONAL COMPETENCIES (Medium)", "CRITICAL COMPETENCIES (Wide)"
- Stats at bottom: 71%, 3/100, 42%
- Subtitle at bottom (not centered title): "Dual Competency Framework: What You Need vs. What You're Getting"
- Minimal icons for each category

**Content Accuracy:**
- ✅ Current: Tool awareness only, No evaluation skills, No critical frameworks, Insufficient for industry demands
- ✅ Functional: Deploy AI tools, Interpret outputs, Select applications, Troubleshoot failures
- ✅ Critical: Evaluate vendor claims, Assess compliance, Audit for bias, Articulate trade-offs, Advocate responsibly
- ✅ Stats: 71% Skills Gap, 3/100 Programs, 42% Zero ROI ✅

**Strengths:**
- ✅✅ **NO CENTERED TITLE** (proper embedded context!) - Subtitle at bottom is acceptable
- ✅✅ Cleanest, most scannable design
- ✅ Excellent CONCISE tier execution (minimal text, category names only)
- ✅ Good white space (~35-40%)
- ✅ Three-column width clearly shows gap (narrow vs wide)
- ✅ GAP arrow reinforces central message
- ✅ All key statistics present (71%, 3/100, 42%)
- ✅ Color scheme perfect (gray #718096, blue #4299E1, purple #6B46C1)
- ✅ Simple icons, not cluttered
- ✅ At-a-glance comprehension (15-30 seconds)

**Weaknesses:**
- Minor: Could have 40%+ white space (currently ~35-40%)

**Estimated Score:** 91/100 - Outstanding
**Recommendation:** **USE THIS VARIANT** - best CONCISE tier execution, proper embedded context

---

### Variant 3: Detailed Text Descriptions

**Visual Design:**
- Three columns with detailed explanatory text
- Multiple GAP arrows
- Extensive bullet points with sub-text (e.g., "Deploy AI tools (Draft content, schedule vendors...)")
- Stats at bottom: 71% skills gaps, 42% REPORT ZERO ROI, 91% FAN OPPOSITION
- Each column has subheadings: "SURFACE-LEVEL TOOL AWARENESS", "OPERATIONAL AI LITERACY", "ANALYTICAL AI LITERACY"

**Content Accuracy:**
- ✅ Functional competencies accurately described
- ✅ Critical competencies accurately described
- ✅ Stats: 71%, 42%, 91% ✅
- ✅ Content matches source material

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Comprehensive detail (would be good for DETAILED tier)
- ✅ Color scheme correct
- ✅ All statistics present
- ✅ Three-column structure shows gap

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **CRITICAL: HAS CENTERED TITLE** - "Dual Competency Framework: What You Need vs. What You're Getting" violates embedded context
- ❌ **TIER MISMATCH: This is DETAILED tier, not CONCISE tier**
  - Extensive explanatory text in parentheses
  - Sub-bullets with detailed descriptions
  - "Deploy AI tools (Draft content, schedule vendors, configure chatbots)" is too detailed
  - "Evaluate vendor claims (Evidence-based frameworks, baseline comparisons)" is too detailed
- ❌ White space ~20-25% (far below 40% CONCISE target)
- ❌ Too much text to scan in 15-30 seconds (would take 2-3 minutes)
- ❌ Violates "MINIMAL TEXT (category names ONLY, no explanatory paragraphs)" requirement

**Estimated Score:** 68/100 - Fair (tier mismatch + title violation)
**Recommendation:** Cannot use - wrong tier AND embedded context violation

---

## Winner: Variant 2 ⭐⭐

**Rationale:**
1. **Only variant without centered title** - Proper embedded context execution (subtitle at bottom is acceptable)
2. **Best CONCISE tier execution** - Minimal text, category names only, no explanatory paragraphs
3. **Clean three-column layout** - Width clearly shows gap (narrow → medium → wide)
4. **Good white space** - ~35-40% (close to 40% target)
5. **All key statistics** - 71% skills gap, 3/100 programs, 42% zero ROI
6. **At-a-glance comprehension** - 15-30 seconds (CONCISE goal)
7. **Perfect color scheme** - Gray, blue, purple matching EventAI palette

**Variant Rankings:**
1. **Variant 2** - 91/100 (Outstanding - use this) ⭐⭐
2. Variant 1 - 76/100 (Fair - title violation)
3. Variant 3 - 68/100 (Fair - tier mismatch + title violation)

## Critical Issues Identified

**Variants 1 & 3: Embedded Context Violation**
- Both have centered titles at top
- Embedded infographics should NOT have titles (title is in figure caption)
- Only Variant 2 correctly omits centered title

**Variant 3: Tier Mismatch**
- Prompt specified CONCISE tier (minimal text, 40%+ white space)
- Variant 3 generated as DETAILED tier (comprehensive text, explanatory paragraphs)
- Far too information-dense for CONCISE requirements

**Variant 2: Perfect Execution ✅**
- No centered title (subtitle at bottom is acceptable positioning)
- CONCISE tier achieved (category names only)
- Proper white space (~35-40%)
- Clean, scannable, meets all requirements
