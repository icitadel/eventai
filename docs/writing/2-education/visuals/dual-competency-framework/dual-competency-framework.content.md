# VIS-2.4: Dual Competency Framework - What You Need vs. What You're Getting

**Infographic Purpose**: Visualize the gap between current training (surface-level tool awareness) and the dual competency framework students actually need (functional + critical skills). Provides actionable framework.

---

## Column 1: Current Training (What You're Getting)

### Surface-Level Tool Awareness

**Typical Coverage in Available Training**:
- Use ChatGPT to draft event marketing copy
- Understand that predictive analytics can forecast attendance
- Know that AI chatbots can handle customer service inquiries
- Aware that RFID and facial recognition technologies exist

**Characteristics**:
- Tool existence awareness (not proficiency)
- "Awareness that X exists" not "ability to deploy X effectively"
- No frameworks for evaluation or decision-making
- No critical assessment capabilities
- No regulatory knowledge
- No ethical analysis methods

**Result**:
- Graduates know AI tools exist
- Cannot evaluate vendor claims
- Cannot assess regulatory compliance
- Cannot audit for bias
- Cannot make informed deployment decisions

---

## Column 2: Functional Competencies (What You Actually Need)

### Operational AI Literacy

**Competency 1: Deploy AI Tools Appropriately**
- Content creation: Draft event descriptions, marketing copy, social media posts
- Scheduling: Vendor placement, session timing, resource allocation
- Analytics: Attendance forecasting, revenue projections, demand analysis
- Customer service: Chatbot configuration, automated responses, FAQ handling

**Competency 2: Interpret Data Visualizations and Predictive Model Outputs**
- Read analytics dashboards accurately
- Understand confidence intervals and prediction ranges
- Interpret model outputs (what does "78% likelihood" actually mean?)
- Distinguish correlation from causation in AI-generated insights

**Competency 3: Select Appropriate AI Applications**
- Match AI tools to specific festival challenges
- Understand which problems AI can/cannot solve
- Evaluate tool capabilities against operational needs
- Know when NOT to deploy AI (human judgment more appropriate)

**Competency 4: Troubleshoot Common AI Tool Failures**
- Identify when AI outputs are hallucinations vs. accurate information
- Recognize model drift (performance degrading over time)
- Debug prompt engineering issues
- Escalate to human oversight when AI fails

**Visual Elements**:
- Operational icons: tools, dashboards, workflows, troubleshooting symbols
- Festival context: scheduling grids, analytics charts, chatbot interfaces
- Action-oriented (deploy, interpret, select, troubleshoot verbs)

---

## Column 3: Critical Competencies (What You Actually Need)

### Analytical AI Literacy

**Competency 1: Evaluate Vendor Claims Using Evidence-Based Frameworks**

**Methods**:
- Baseline comparisons: "92% accuracy compared to what baseline?"
- Independent validation: "Who funded the study? Independent researchers or vendor?"
- Sample sizes: "How many events/attendees in test? Representative conditions?"
- Test condition scrutiny: "Were tests conducted in outdoor festivals with spotty WiFi?"
- Evidence rigor assessment: "Is this claim peer-reviewed or marketing material?"

**Festival Application**:
- Vendor proposes AI crowd monitoring with "92% accuracy"
- Critical evaluation: Accuracy metric undefined, test conditions unclear, vendor-funded study, no independent validation
- Decision: Request independent evidence or pilot test before purchase

---

**Competency 2: Assess Regulatory Compliance**

**Frameworks**:
- GDPR (EU): Article 9 requirements for biometric data processing
- BIPA (Illinois): Biometric Information Privacy Act for facial recognition
- CCPA (California): California Consumer Privacy Act for data collection
- Proportionality principles: Is biometric processing proportionate to goal?

**Festival Application**:
- Vendor proposes facial recognition for festival entry
- Critical assessment:
  - GDPR Article 9: Special category data, explicit consent required
  - Proportionality: Is biometric processing proportionate to "faster entry" goal?
  - Danish DPA precedent: Approved for football (violence risk), denied for concerts
  - Voluntariness: What happens to attendees who decline? Are they penalized?
- Decision: Likely disproportionate, high regulatory risk, recommend alternative

---

**Competency 3: Audit AI Systems for Demographic Bias and Fairness**

**Methods**:
- Training data analysis: What data was used? Representative of festival demographics?
- Demographic testing: Does system perform equally across race, gender, age groups?
- Disparate impact assessment: Are certain groups disproportionately affected?
- Liability evaluation: Who's liable when biased outcomes cause discrimination?

**Festival Application**:
- AI recruitment tool deployed to screen festival staff applications
- Critical audit questions:
  - Does algorithm penalize non-traditional career paths?
  - Are certain demographic groups filtered out at higher rates?
  - What training data was used? (If trained on corporate hiring, may not fit festival culture)
  - Who's liable for discrimination lawsuits if bias is discovered?
- Decision: Require bias audit before deployment, document testing results

---

**Competency 4: Articulate Ethical Trade-Offs**

**Trade-Off Categories**:
- Efficiency vs. Privacy: Faster processes vs. data collection/surveillance
- Personalization vs. Filter Bubbles: Customized experiences vs. limiting exposure to new artists/genres
- Automation vs. Employment: Cost savings vs. festival worker job displacement
- Revenue Optimization vs. Accessibility: Dynamic pricing vs. excluding lower-income fans

**Festival Application**:
- Dynamic pricing proposed to "optimize revenue" (20-30% increase projected)
- Critical trade-off analysis:
  - Optimize for whom? Festival, artists, attendees, or ticket platforms?
  - Accessibility impact: Does surge pricing exclude lower-income fans?
  - Values alignment: Contradicts stated mission of diversity and inclusion?
  - Cultural implications: Attendance as market transaction vs. community gathering?
  - Long-term consequences: 91% UK fan opposition, regulatory investigations
- Decision: Recommend against dynamic pricing, misaligned with organizational values

---

**Competency 5: Advocate for Responsible AI Deployment**

**Methods**:
- Articulate organizational values and how AI deployment aligns/contradicts
- Build coalition of stakeholders (artists, attendees, staff, sponsors)
- Present evidence-based arguments to leadership
- Propose alternatives when AI deployment is inappropriate
- Design values-aligned AI systems (not just accept vendor defaults)

**Festival Application**:
- Leadership proposes AI social media monitoring tool to flag "concerning" attendee posts
- Critical advocacy questions:
  - Who defines "concerning"? Who sets the parameters?
  - Could this suppress legitimate criticism or activism?
  - What are the free speech implications?
  - Does this align with festival culture of openness and artistic expression?
- Advocacy action: Present evidence of chilling effects, propose alternative community moderation approaches

## The Gap Visualization

### Current Training (Narrow Column)
- 4 items: Tool awareness only
- Insufficient for industry demands
- Visual: Narrow, limited scope

### Functional Competencies (Medium Column)
- 4 categories: Deploy, interpret, select, troubleshoot
- Operational proficiency
- Visual: Medium width, operational icons

### Critical Competencies (Wide Column)
- 5 categories: Evaluate claims, assess compliance, audit bias, articulate trade-offs, advocate
- Analytical depth required
- Visual: Wide column, emphasis on breadth/depth of critical skills

**Central Message**: Current training ≠ Industry needs. Dual competency (functional + critical) required.
