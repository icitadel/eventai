# Dual Competency Framework: What You Need vs. What You're Getting

Create a **CONCISE-tier** three-column comparison showing the gap between current training and needed competencies.

🚨 CRITICAL: MAXIMUM SIMPLICITY - CATEGORY NAMES + MINIMAL TEXT ONLY 🚨

## Visual Type
Three-column comparison | Landscape | CONCISE (key categories ONLY, 40%+ white space, minimal text)

## Column 1: Current Training (Narrow) - Gray #718096
**What You're Getting:**
- Tool awareness only
- No evaluation skills
- No critical frameworks

**Visual:** Narrow column (~15% width), visually insufficient

## Column 2: Functional Competencies (Medium) - Blue #4299E1
**What You Actually Need (Functional):**
- Deploy AI tools
- Interpret outputs
- Select applications
- Troubleshoot failures

**Visual:** Medium column (~30% width), operational icons

## Column 3: Critical Competencies (Wide) - Purple #6B46C1
**What You Actually Need (Critical):**
- Evaluate vendor claims
- Assess compliance
- Audit for bias
- Articulate trade-offs
- Advocate responsibly

**Visual:** Wide column (~55% width), analytical icons

## The Gap Visualization
- Column 1 (Current) is visibly narrow/insufficient
- Columns 2+3 (Needed) are visibly wider/comprehensive
- Visual emphasis: "Current training ≠ Industry needs"

## Colors
- Current Training: Medium gray #718096
- Functional: Sky blue #4299E1
- Critical: Deep purple #6B46C1
- Gap indicators: Electric coral #FF6B6B
- Text: Midnight slate #2D3748
- Background: Pure white #FFFFFF

## Requirements
- **NO TITLE** (embedded context, caption provides context)
- **40%+ WHITE SPACE** (maximum breathing room, generous margins)
- **MINIMAL TEXT** (category names ONLY, no explanatory paragraphs)
- Three-column layout with clear width differences (narrow ~15% → medium ~30% → wide ~55%)
- Simple bullet points or icons for each category
- Visual emphasis on width gap (current narrow vs. needed wide)
- At-a-glance 15-30 second comprehension
- Landscape aspect ratio (wider than tall)

## Context
EMBEDDED in education section text. Caption will provide context. Visual must stand alone but without title.
