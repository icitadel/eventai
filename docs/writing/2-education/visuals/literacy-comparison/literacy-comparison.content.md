# VIS-2.1: Functional vs. Critical AI Literacy

**Infographic Purpose**: Clearly distinguish between using AI tools (functional literacy) and questioning AI systems (critical literacy) in festival/event management context.

---

## Two Types of AI Literacy

### Functional AI Literacy

**Definition**: Ability to use AI tools and understand basic mechanics

**Key Questions**:
- How does this tool work?
- What prompts get the best results?
- Which features should I use for this task?

**Festival Example**:
- Use ChatGPT to write event descriptions
- Deploy AI chatbot for attendee questions
- Implement recommendation algorithm for schedule building

**Training Available**:
- **MPI AI Certificate Program**: 7.5 hours, $300-700
- **PCMA AI for Event Planners**: Online self-paced courses
- **Vendor-provided training**: Free but sales-focused
- **Focus**: Tool proficiency, prompt engineering, feature usage

### Critical AI Literacy

**Definition**: Ability to question, evaluate, and challenge AI systems and their societal impacts

**Key Questions**:
- Whose interests does this system serve?
- What biases might be embedded in the algorithm?
- What are the privacy implications?
- Who benefits and who is harmed?
- Is the claimed ROI evidence-based?

**Festival Example**:
- Evaluate whether AI recommendations prioritize sponsored content
- Assess if facial recognition system disproportionately misidentifies certain groups
- Question if dynamic pricing exploits vulnerable attendees
- Examine data retention policies and consent architecture

**Training Available**:
- **Currently**: Virtually non-existent in event management education
- **Proposed**: Semester-long course (15 weeks)
- **Content**: Regulatory frameworks (GDPR, EU AI Act), algorithmic bias, ethical dilemmas
- **Focus**: Critical evaluation, evidence assessment, policy development

---

## The Gap

### Current State:
- **Functional literacy**: Growing rapidly (vendors provide tools and training)
- **Critical literacy**: Essentially absent in event/hospitality education
- **Result**: 71% of event professionals lack AI skills to evaluate vendor claims

### Why This Matters:
- **42%** of organizations report **zero ROI** from AI investments
- Professionals trained only by vendors (incentivized to oversell)
- Lack critical frameworks to assess:
  - Evidence quality (is the claimed 40% efficiency gain real?)
  - Regulatory compliance (are we violating GDPR?)
  - Ethical implications (is this fair to attendees?)

### Academic Integration:
- **3 out of 100+** hospitality/event programs include AI modules (3% coverage)
- Programs WITH AI: University of Surrey, Southern Cross, Penn State
- Programs WITHOUT: Leeds Beckett UKCEM, UCF Rosen (zero documented AI content)

---

## Ideal State: Functional + Critical Together

**Not Either/Or**:
- Need BOTH types of literacy
- Functional: Execute AI deployments effectively
- Critical: Make informed decisions about WHEN and HOW to deploy

**Example**:
- **Functional**: Know how to configure a recommendation algorithm
- **Critical**: Understand when algorithmic curation harms serendipity and how to preserve user agency

## Visual Design Notes

**Layout**: Side-by-side comparison (landscape orientation)
- Left column: Functional AI Literacy
- Right column: Critical AI Literacy
- Center: "The Gap" section highlighting absence of critical literacy

**Key Stats to Highlight**:
- MPI/PCMA: 7.5 hrs, $300-700 (functional)
- Proposed: 15 weeks semester course (critical)
- 3% academic coverage (3/100+ programs)
- 71% skills gap
- 42% zero ROI

**Visual Elements**:
- Festival context icons (not generic business imagery)
- Clear distinction between "using tools" vs "questioning systems"
- Professional + whimsy style (EventAI brand)

**Color Guidance**:
- Functional literacy: Sky blue (#4299E1) - practical, tool-focused
- Critical literacy: Deep purple (#6B46C1) - thoughtful, analytical
- Gap/warning: Electric coral (#FF6B6B) - urgency, concern
