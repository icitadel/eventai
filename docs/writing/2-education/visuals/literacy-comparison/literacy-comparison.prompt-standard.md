# Functional vs. Critical AI Literacy Comparison

Create a **CONCISE-tier** side-by-side comparison infographic showing the distinction between functional and critical AI literacy in festival/event management education.

## Visual Type
Side-by-side comparison infographic | Landscape | Festival/event management context | CONCISE information density (key differences + headline stats ONLY, 40%+ white space)

## Layout
Left: Functional AI Literacy | Right: Critical AI Literacy | Center callout: The Gap

## Functional AI Literacy (Left - Blue #4299E1)

**Definition**: Use AI tools, understand basic mechanics

**Questions**:
- How does it work?
- Best prompts?
- Which features for this task?

**Festival Examples**:
- ChatGPT for event descriptions
- AI chatbot for attendee questions
- Recommendation algorithm for schedules

**Training**:
- MPI AI Certificate: 7.5 hrs, $300-700
- PCMA online courses
- Vendor training (free, sales-focused)
- Focus: Tool proficiency, prompts, features

## Critical AI Literacy (Right - Purple #6B46C1)

**Definition**: Question, evaluate, challenge AI systems and societal impacts

**Questions**:
- Whose interests served?
- Embedded biases?
- Privacy implications?
- Who benefits/harmed?
- Evidence-based ROI claims?

**Festival Examples**:
- Evaluate if recommendations prioritize sponsors
- Assess facial recognition bias
- Question dynamic pricing exploitation
- Examine data retention + consent

**Training**:
- Currently: Virtually non-existent
- Proposed: 15-week semester course
- Content: GDPR, EU AI Act, algorithmic bias, ethics
- Focus: Critical evaluation, evidence assessment, policy

## The Gap (Center - Coral #FF6B6B)

**Current State**:
- Functional: Growing (vendor-driven)
- Critical: Absent in education
- Result: **71% lack AI evaluation skills**

**Consequences**:
- **42% zero ROI** from AI investments
- Vendor-only training (overselling incentive)
- Can't assess evidence, compliance, ethics

**Academic Coverage**:
- **3/100+ programs** have AI modules (3%)
- With AI: Surrey, Southern Cross, Penn State
- Without: Leeds Beckett UKCEM, UCF Rosen

## Need Both Types

Not either/or - require functional AND critical
- Functional: Execute deployments
- Critical: Decide WHEN and HOW to deploy

Example: Configure algorithm (functional) + understand serendipity impact (critical)

## Design Requirements

**CRITICAL - FESTIVAL CONTEXT INTEGRATION (ENFORCED FOR 90%+):**
- ❌ DO NOT limit festival elements to header/footer only
- ✅ MUST integrate festival context THROUGHOUT all content areas
- ✅ REQUIRED: Tent/stage illustrations at TOP AND BOTTOM
- ✅ REQUIRED: Festival icons (wristbands, stages, crowds) WITHIN each column content
- ✅ REQUIRED: Every section must have visible festival atmosphere
- Goal: Immediately recognizable as festival industry content (not generic business)

**Colors**:
- Functional: Sky blue #4299E1
- Critical: Deep purple #6B46C1
- Gap: Electric coral #FF6B6B
- Text: Midnight slate #2D3748
- Background: Pure white #FFFFFF
- ✅ WCAG AA contrast minimum 4.5:1 for all text

**Typography (ENFORCED FOR 90%+):**
- Headers: Inter bold 24-36pt
- Body: Source Sans Pro **16-18pt MINIMUM** (NOT 14pt - must be print-ready)
- Stats: Inter bold 48-72pt
- ❌ NO TEXT BELOW 16PT (critical for accessibility + print)

**Style** (Tufte Principles):
- **Graphical excellence**: Information-dense yet clear, rewards attention
- **High data-ink ratio**: Every pixel serves the data, minimal decoration/cruft
- **Graphical integrity**: Visual proportions match data proportions
- Festival context icons INTEGRATED in content (stages, wristbands, NOT generic business)
- Semi-flat with subtle depth
- Rounded corners 8-12px
- 2-3px outlines
- Professional + whimsy balance (80% credible structure, 20% festival personality)
- White space ≥30% composition

**Key Stats**:
- 7.5 hrs vs 15 weeks
- $300-700 vs semester course
- 3% coverage (3/100+)
- 71% skills gap
- 42% zero ROI
