Left: Functional AI Literacy | Right: Critical AI Literacy | Center callout: The Gap

## Functional AI Literacy (Left - Blue #4299E1)

**Definition**: Use AI tools, understand basic mechanics

**Questions**:
- How does it work?
- Best prompts?
- Which features for this task?

**Festival Examples**:
- ChatGPT for event descriptions
- AI chatbot for attendee questions
- Recommendation algorithm for schedules

**Training**:
- MPI AI Certificate: 7.5 hrs, $300-700
- PCMA online courses
- Vendor training (free, sales-focused)
- Focus: Tool proficiency, prompts, features

## Critical AI Literacy (Right - Purple #6B46C1)

**Definition**: Question, evaluate, challenge AI systems and societal impacts

**Questions**:
- Whose interests served?
- Embedded biases?
- Privacy implications?
- Who benefits/harmed?
- Evidence-based ROI claims?

**Festival Examples**:
- Evaluate if recommendations prioritize sponsors
- Assess facial recognition bias
- Question dynamic pricing exploitation
- Examine data retention + consent

**Training**:
- Currently: Virtually non-existent
- Proposed: 15-week semester course
- Content: GDPR, EU AI Act, algorithmic bias, ethics
- Focus: Critical evaluation, evidence assessment, policy

## The Gap (Center - Coral #FF6B6B)

**Current State**:
- Functional: Growing (vendor-driven)
- Critical: Absent in education
- Result: **71% lack AI evaluation skills**

**Consequences**:
- **42% zero ROI** from AI investments
- Vendor-only training (overselling incentive)
- Can't assess evidence, compliance, ethics

**Academic Coverage**:
- **3/100+ programs** have AI modules (3%)
- With AI: Surrey, Southern Cross, Penn State
- Without: Leeds Beckett UKCEM, UCF Rosen

## Need Both Types

Not either/or - require functional AND critical
- Functional: Execute deployments
- Critical: Decide WHEN and HOW to deploy

Example: Configure algorithm (functional) + understand serendipity impact (critical)

## Design Requirements

**Colors**:
- Functional: Sky blue #4299E1
- Critical: Deep purple #6B46C1
- Gap: Electric coral #FF6B6B
- Text: Midnight slate #2D3748
- Background: Pure white #FFFFFF

**Typography**:
- Headers: Inter bold 24-36pt
- Body: Source Sans Pro 14-16pt
- Stats: Inter bold 48-72pt

**Style**:
- Festival context icons (stages, wristbands, NOT generic business)
- Semi-flat with subtle depth
- Rounded corners 8-12px
- 2-3px outlines
- High data-ink ratio
- Professional + energetic mood
- White space ≥30%

**Key Stats**:
- 7.5 hrs vs 15 weeks
- $300-700 vs semester course
- 3% coverage (3/100+)
- 71% skills gap
- 42% zero ROI
