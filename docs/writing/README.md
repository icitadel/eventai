## Five Core Questions

### Question 1: Long-term AI Future Vision (Transformation)
> **In your view, what is the ultimate, long-term future of AI in the festival and live events industry over the next decade? What will be the most significant, visible difference between a non-AI-driven event and an AI-optimized event for the average attendee?**

**Draft**: [1-transformation/drafts/transformation.draft.md](1-transformation/drafts/transformation.draft.md) (3,400 words)

---

### Question 2: Critical AI Literacy in Education
> **For university students pursuing degrees in event management, why is learning about AI not just about using the tools (functional literacy), but also about understanding its ethical, economic, and philosophical implications (critical literacy)?**

**Draft**: [2-education/drafts/education.draft.md](2-education/drafts/education.draft.md) (3,100 words)

---

### Question 3: Innovative On-Site Personalization
> **AI can personalize the attendee journey (e.g., personalized schedules, content recommendations). What is the most innovative example you have seen of AI being used on-site at a large festival to enhance the individual fan experience in a way that feels organic and non-intrusive?**

**Draft**: [3-personalization/drafts/personalization.draft.md](3-personalization/drafts/personalization.draft.md) (draft complete)

---

### Question 4: Surveillance Ethics and Privacy Risks
> **With the use of AI for real-time crowd movement analysis, facial recognition, and sentiment tracking, what are the primary ethical and data privacy risks festival organizers must address to use these tools for security and safety responsibly?**

**Draft**: [4-privacy/drafts/privacy.draft.md](4-privacy/drafts/privacy.draft.md) (draft complete)

---

### Question 5: Real-Time Predictive Analytics for Operations
> **Festivals often operate on razor-thin margins. How is AI moving beyond simple historical analysis to enable genuine, real-time predictive analytics that festival organizers can use to forecast ticket demand, dynamically set pricing, and accurately allocate resources like food, beverage, and staffing?**

**Draft**: [5-analytics/drafts/analytics.draft.md](5-analytics/drafts/analytics.draft.md) (draft complete)
