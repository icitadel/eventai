## ❌ AVOID

**DO NOT USE:**
- ❌ Vertical flowchart (use horizontal journey)
- ❌ Generic corporate flowchart boxes (use festival gates)
- ❌ Beige/cream backgrounds (MUST be pure white #FFFFFF)
- ❌ Diamond shapes (use gate/arch structures)
- ❌ Traditional flowchart arrows only (use visual journey)
- ❌ Generic office imagery (clipboards, suits, desks)
- ❌ Robot/AI clichés (circuit brains, AI overlords)
- ❌ Text smaller than 12pt (except 11pt regulatory references)
- ❌ Cluttered composition (<20% white space)
- ❌ Dark backgrounds (must be white)

---

## ✅ REFERENCE FOR VISUAL QUALITY

**Successful elements from EU AI Act infographic (91/100):**
- Small illustrations within zones (festival context)
- Equal visual weight for each checkpoint
- Clean white background
- Professional + whimsy balance (serious content, engaging visuals)
- Information-rich without clutter
- EventAI color palette exactness

**Apply to this visual:**
- Gates = festival security checkpoints (familiar context)
- Person progressing = visual storytelling (journey)
- Violation boxes below = clear consequences
- Success zone = rewarding endpoint
- Minimal cruft = high data-ink ratio
- Festival icons = distinctive EventAI identity

---

## REGULATORY ACCURACY (Verify in Visual)

**GATE 1 - Article 5(1)(c):** Data minimization - cannot collect unnecessary biometric data
**GATE 2 - Article 9:** Special category data - biometric requires explicit consent
**GATE 3 - Autonomy:** Cannot coerce consent or penalize opt-out
**GATE 4 - Article 5(1)(e):** Storage limitation - must delete on schedule
**GATE 5 - Article 35:** DPIA mandatory for high-risk processing

**Fine Amounts (Verify Exact):**
- Standard violation: €20M or 4% global annual turnover
- Serious violations: €35M or 7% global annual turnover (not applicable to these violations)
- Enforcement: National Data Protection Authority

**Real Examples (Optional to Include):**
- ✅ Danish football: DPA-approved biometric system (explicit consent, clear signage)
- ❌ Taylor Swift Rose Bowl: Secret facial scanning (no consent, regulatory investigation)
- ❌ Clearview AI: Mass biometric scraping (indefinite retention, €35M+ fines)
