## Detailed Evaluation by Variant - Round 5

### ❌ Variant #7: REJECTED - VETO CONDITION VIOLATED

**Title:** "GDPR Biometric Compliance: Festival Entry Gates"

**Status:** ❌ **REJECTED - Blue background header**

#### Critical Issue - VETO Condition

**VETO Failure:** Blue header background (#4299E1 or similar)
- **Required:** Pure white #FFFFFF background
- **Actual:** Blue header bar across top
- **Impact:** Violates EventAI Visual Identity Guide requirement
- **Severity:** AUTOMATIC REJECTION (same as factual error or wrong density tier)

**No scoring performed** - VETO conditions must pass before detailed evaluation.

**Why This Matters:**
- White background is non-negotiable requirement (like density tier compliance)
- Blue header reduces contrast and visual clarity
- Not consistent with EventAI brand standards
- Would require regeneration to fix

---

## Cross-Round Learning: Clarity vs Complexity

### Key Insights from User Feedback

**What Works (Variant #4, #8 approach):**
- ✅ Simple archway gates (traditional structure)
- ✅ Minimal 3D effects (just enough for depth)
- ✅ Clear labels inside gates
- ✅ Straightforward horizontal flow
- ✅ **Result:** Maximum clarity and comprehension

**What Doesn't Help (Variants #5, #6, #9):**
- ❌ Heavy 3D rendering (#5) - Visual complexity doesn't aid comprehension
- ❌ Abstract rounded badges (#6, #9) - Less immediately recognizable as gates
- ❌ **Result:** Aesthetic appeal doesn't guarantee clarity

**Critical Lesson:**
> **Comprehension > Visual Complexity**
>
> For decision-tree infographics, clarity and readability trump aesthetic sophistication. Traditional metaphors (archways) outperform abstract designs (rounded badges) for immediate understanding.
