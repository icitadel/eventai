# EU AI Act Risk Classification - Three-Tier Pyramid

Three-tier pyramid: EU AI Act biometric system risk classification for festivals

🚨 CRITICAL: Pure white background #FFFFFF, three equal-height tiers (prohibited/high-risk/limited-risk), festival context, exact regulatory details

## STRUCTURE

Vertical pyramid: top tier (prohibited, smallest), middle tier (high-risk), bottom tier (limited-risk, widest)
Each tier: colored background + title + regulatory stat + practice list + icon

## TIERS (Top to Bottom)

### TIER 1: PROHIBITED (Red #FF6B6B - Top)
Title: "PROHIBITED" (28-32pt bold, white)
Stat: "€35M or 7% Turnover Fine" (40-48pt bold, white)
Enforcement: "Since Feb 2, 2025" (18-20pt white)
Practices (white text, 14-16pt):
- Real-time biometric ID in public spaces
- Untargeted web scraping (Clearview AI-style)
- Emotion recognition systems
Icon: Prohibition symbol + enforcement badge

### TIER 2: HIGH-RISK (Orange #ED8936 - Middle)
Title: "HIGH-RISK" (28-32pt bold, dark)
Stat: "Conformity Assessment Required" (32-36pt bold, orange)
Requirements (dark text, 14-16pt):
- Post-event biometric ID permitted
- Mandatory third-party assessment
- Technical documentation
- Human oversight, impact assessments
- Transparent disclosure to attendees
Real example: ✅ Danish football (DPA-approved with safeguards)
Icon: Warning symbol + checklist

### TIER 3: LIMITED-RISK (Green #48BB78 - Bottom)
Title: "LIMITED-RISK" (28-32pt bold, dark)
Stat: "Disclosure Only" (32-36pt bold, green)
Allowed (dark text, 14-16pt):
- Chatbots with AI disclosure
- Recommendation systems (transparent, user choice)
- No biometric data collection
- High user agency
Icon: Checkmark + information symbol

## STYLE

Background: Pure white #FFFFFF (exactly, not cream/beige)
Tier colors: Exact hex codes (red #FF6B6B, orange #ED8936, green #48BB78)
Text: White on red/orange/green for contrast, dark slate #2D3748 on light backgrounds
Typography: Inter/Roboto bold titles, Source Sans/Lato body, 14pt minimum
Icons: Regulatory context (badges, prohibition, warnings, checks) NOT generic
Borders: Midnight slate #2D3748, 2-3px, rounded corners 8-12px
Layout: Semi-flat, equal tier heights, 25-30% white space, balanced proportions
Equal tiers: Each tier approximately same height (visual equality)

## ❌ AVOID

Cream/beige backgrounds (#F5F5DC, #F7F3ED, #FEFDFB), generic business icons, unequal tier sizes, text <14pt, cramped layout, horizontal layouts (use VERTICAL pyramid), missing enforcement date, incorrect fine amounts

## ✅ REFERENCE

Three-tier pyramid structure, color-coded risk levels, clear regulatory tier labels, festival deployment context (not generic legal diagram)

## KEY REGULATORY DETAILS (Embed in visual)

**Prohibited Tier:**
- €35M or 7% global turnover (whichever higher)
- Enforcement: February 2, 2025
- Scope: Private organizers (not law enforcement exception)
- Examples: Real-time facial ID, emotion recognition, mass web scraping

**High-Risk Tier:**
- Post-event biometric ID allowed (with safeguards)
- Requires conformity assessment (independent audit)
- Documentation mandatory (technical specs, training data, accuracy)
- Real example: Danish police football matches (✅ approved)
- Rejection example: Taylor Swift Rose Bowl (❌ no consent, no safeguards)

**Limited-Risk Tier:**
- AI disclosure required (transparent chatbots)
- Recommendation algorithms (user choice, alternatives)
- No biometric data (core distinction)
- Example: "You might enjoy..." vendor suggestions with opt-out

## VISUAL NARRATIVE

"Risk classification determines what's banned, regulated, or permitted. Prohibited = criminal penalties. High-risk = compliance burden. Limited-risk = disclosure only. All apply to festival deployments."
