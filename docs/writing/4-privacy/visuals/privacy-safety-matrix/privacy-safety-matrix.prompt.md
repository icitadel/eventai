# Privacy vs. Safety Trade-Off Matrix

Two-axis decision matrix: Safety threat (Y-axis) vs. Privacy intrusion (X-axis). Four quadrants with real festival cases.

🚨 CRITICAL: PURE WHITE #FFFFFF BACKGROUND (NOT gray, NOT cream, NOT off-white), saturated colored borders with light pastel fills (EU AI Act pyramid style), black text on pastel backgrounds for contrast, label-only text (3-5 words max), case studies with ✅/❌ verdicts, 40%+ white space, COLOR-BLIND ACCESSIBLE (color + icons + text labels triple encoding, NO quadrant numbers)

## DATA POINTS

**Quadrants (Four color-coded regions):**
Bottom-Left (Green #48BB78): ✅ APPROPRIATE | Standard CCTV ✅
Bottom-Right (Red #FF6B6B): ❌ ILLEGAL | Taylor Swift 2018 ❌
Top-Left (Yellow #F6AD55): ⚠️ CONSTRAINED | Limited options
Top-Right (Orange #ED8936): ⚠️ CONDITIONAL | Danish football ✅ (with safeguards)

**Axes (Labeled scales):**
X-Axis: Privacy Intrusion (Low: CCTV → High: Mass facial recognition)
Y-Axis: Safety Threat (Low: General security → High: Terrorism)

**Cases (Real examples positioned in quadrants):**
Danish football: High threat, High intrusion, Approved with safeguards
Taylor Swift 2018: Low threat, High intrusion, Rejected (60K scans, no consent)
Standard festival: Low threat, Low intrusion, Compliant

## STYLE

Background: PURE WHITE #FFFFFF (mandatory - NOT light gray, NOT cream, NOT #F8F8F8)

Quadrant visual treatment (inspired by EU AI Act pyramid style):
- Q1 (Appropriate): Saturated GREEN #48BB78 border (thick, 4-6px), light pastel green fill (#E6F7ED), black text
- Q2 (Illegal): Saturated RED #FF6B6B border (thick, 4-6px), light pastel red/pink fill (#FFE6E6), black text
- Q3 (Constrained): Saturated YELLOW #F6AD55 border (thick, 4-6px), light pastel yellow fill (#FFF4E6), black text
- Q4 (Conditional): Saturated ORANGE #ED8936 border (thick, 4-6px), light pastel orange fill (#FFEDE6), black text

Each quadrant header bar: Saturated color background with white text (label + verdict icon)
Quadrant interior: Diffuse/pastel background with black text for excellent contrast

Typography: Inter bold 18-20pt (quadrant labels), Source Sans 14-16pt (case text, black), 12-14pt (axes)
Icons: ✅ ❌ ⚠️ for verdicts (in header bars with white color, or black in body)
White space: 40%+ composition
Context: Embedded (textbook), festival surveillance

Color-blind accessibility (CRITICAL):
- Quadrants differentiated by: COLOR + ICONS + TEXT LABELS (triple encoding)
- Distinct icons for each quadrant status: ✅ checkmark (approved), ❌ X (illegal), ⚠️ warning triangle (constrained/conditional)
- Text labels provide meaning independent of color (APPROPRIATE, ILLEGAL, CONSTRAINED, CONDITIONAL)
- NO quadrant numbers (Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4) - not meaningful data
- Patterns optional but helpful: diagonal lines, dots, or texture fills to further differentiate quadrants
- Test with deuteranopia, protanopia, tritanopia filters - must remain fully usable without color

## STRUCTURE

Four-quadrant matrix with clear axes. Each quadrant color-coded with label and example. Real cases positioned by coordinates. Verdict icons visible.

## ❌ AVOID

Beige backgrounds, fully saturated quadrant fills (use pastel/diffuse fills), white text on saturated colors (use black text on pastels), unclear boundaries, missing verdicts, text <11pt, lengthy explanations, illegal quadrant appearing justified, color-only differentiation (must include icons/text labels), quadrant numbers (Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4)

## ✅ REFERENCE

Matrix (safety × privacy), four quadrants with saturated borders and pastel fills (EU AI Act pyramid style), black text on light backgrounds for contrast, real cases with verdicts, minimal text, excellent readability
