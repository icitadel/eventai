**Saturation Strategy (Tufte-Aligned):**
- ✅✅ **Q1 (Green) background**: ~35% opacity - Light, readable, calm
- ✅✅ **Q2 (Red) background**: ~40% opacity - Light enough to read, dark enough for warning
- ✅✅ **Q3 (Yellow) background**: ~35% opacity - Readable, distinct
- ✅✅ **Q4 (Orange) background**: ~35% opacity - Readable, distinct
- ✅✅ **Prohibition symbol (Q2)**: 100% saturation red - Immediate attention
- ✅✅ **Warning symbols (⚠️)**: 100% saturation - Clear visual cue
- ✅ Pure white background `#FFFFFF`

**Strategic Contrast:**

- ✅ **Case study titles**: Bold, ~14-16pt
- ✅ **Body text**: Regular, ~12-14pt (appears legible)
- ✅ Maximum 2 font families (clean sans-serif throughout)

**Minor Improvement:**
- Some micro-text in safeguards could be 12-14pt (currently appears ~11-12pt)

## Final Recommendation

### Use Variant #5 for Publication ⭐⭐

**Score: 93/100 - APPROVED FOR PUBLICATION**

**Why Variant #5 Wins:**

1. **Achieves 90%+ threshold** (93%) - User's quality target met ✅
2. **Perfect saturation strategy** - Less saturated backgrounds + full saturation emphasis (Tufte-aligned)
3. **Innovative visual cues** - Warning symbols (⚠️) and prohibition symbols (🚫) enhance understanding
4. **Excellent hierarchy** - Bold title, clear quadrants, scannable case studies
5. **Professional credibility** - Appropriate for legal/regulatory decision framework
6. **100% data accuracy** - All claims verified
7. **Applies all learnings** - Incorporates feedback from Batch 1 evaluation

**Key Innovations:**
- Warning symbols (⚠️) for Q3/Q4 immediately signal "conditional/caution"
- Prohibition symbol (🚫) in Q2 reinforces "illegal" message
- Perfect balance of professionalism and visual engagement

**Variant #6 is also excellent (91%)** and could be used as alternative if user prefers Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 labeling prominence.

**Variant #3 remains strongest for festival personality** (95/100 festival context) but falls short of 90% overall (88%). If user prioritizes festival illustrations over professional clarity, #3 is best choice.

---

## Recommendations & Next Steps

### For Variant #5 (Publication-Ready)

**Optional Enhancements (NOT blockers):**
1. Add subtle festival icon near title (wristband, stage outline) - Would boost festival context to 90/100
2. Increase micro-text (safeguards) by 1-2pt for print - Would boost print readiness to 10/10

**Current Status:** Ready for publication as-is. Enhancements would raise score from 93% to 95%+, but not necessary.

---

## Learnings for Future Iterations

### What Worked Perfectly (Variant #5):

1. **Saturation strategy** - 30-40% opacity backgrounds, 100% saturation warnings ✅✅
2. **Visual symbols** - ⚠️ for caution, 🚫 for prohibited - Brilliant addition
3. **Bold title hierarchy** - Dominates appropriately
4. **Clean quadrant differentiation** - Color + labels + symbols work together
5. **Professional + whimsy balance** - 85% professional, 15% engaging

### Apply to All Future Infographics:

- Less saturated backgrounds = readability (confirmed across Batch 2)
- Visual symbols enhance understanding (not just text)
- Strategic saturation = Tufte principle in action
- Professional credibility essential for regulatory topics
