# Consent Architecture Spectrum

Horizontal spectrum showing coercive to voluntary consent designs for festival biometric systems. Left-to-right progression from non-compliant (red) to problematic (orange) to compliant (green).

## Data Points

**Coercive (Left, Red):**
- Mandatory facial recognition - no alternatives
- Bundled consent - accept all or entry denied
- Pre-checked boxes - silence assumed as consent
- Hidden in terms - paragraph 43 of 50-page doc

**Problematic (Middle, Orange):**
- Default opt-in - biometric on unless disabled
- Soft wall penalties - manual ID takes 2 hours vs. 3 min facial
- Confusing interfaces - 15 toggles, unclear language

**Voluntary (Right, Green):**
- Clear opt-in - YES/NO equal prominence
- Genuine alternatives - facial (instant) OR paper ID (5 min) OR manual check (free)
- Granular controls - security/analytics/marketing separate
- Plain language - "We scan your face at entry. Not saved. Not for marketing."
- Easy withdrawal - disable in 30 seconds

## Style

- Colors: Red (#FF6B6B), Orange (#ED8936), Green (#48BB78), White background (#FFFFFF)
