# Consent Architecture Spectrum

Horizontal spectrum: Coercive to Voluntary consent designs for festival biometric systems

🚨 CRITICAL: Pure white background #FFFFFF, left-to-right progression (coercive → voluntary), three distinct color zones, real examples, GDPR principles embedded

## STRUCTURE

Horizontal spectrum bar: Left (coercive red) → Middle (problematic orange) → Right (voluntary green)
Three sections with examples, icons, user agency, legal status
Top: Spectrum gradient bar
Bottom: Principle callouts (Article 7, Article 9 requirements)

## SPECTRUM SECTIONS (Left to Right)

### COERCIVE (Left, Red #FF6B6B) - Non-Compliant
Examples (each with icon + title + description):
1. Mandatory Facial Recognition
   "Facial ID required. No alternatives."
   Icon: Prohibition symbol, single path
   User choice: Zero
   Legal: PROHIBITED (Article 9 violation)

2. Bundled Consent
   "Accept liability + biometrics + marketing + analytics OR deny entry"
   Icon: Package/bundle with lock
   User choice: All or nothing
   Legal: VIOLATES Article 7 (not granular)

3. Pre-Checked Boxes
   "☑ Yes, use my face for security" (already checked)
   Icon: Checked checkbox, no cursor
   User choice: Must uncheck
   Legal: ILLEGAL (silence ≠ consent)

4. Hidden in Terms
   "Biometric policy in paragraph 43(d) of 50-page document"
   Icon: Scroll, small text, magnifying glass
   User choice: Not practically available
   Legal: VIOLATES Article 9 (not informed)

### PROBLEMATIC (Middle, Orange #ED8936) - Gray Area
Examples:
1. Default Opt-In
   "Biometric on by default. Disable in settings."
   Icon: Toggle switch (on), settings icon
   User choice: Yes unless user finds disable
   Legal: LIKELY VIOLATES Article 7

2. Soft Wall Penalties
   "Facial recognition (3 min) OR ID check (2 hours)"
   Icon: Two paths, one wide/fast, one narrow/slow
   User choice: Technically available, practically coercive
   Legal: VIOLATES autonomy

3. Confusing Interface
   "15 toggles, unclear language, contradictory options"
   Icon: Question marks, tangled paths
   User choice: Confused consent
   Legal: VIOLATES Article 9 (not clear/understood)

### VOLUNTARY (Right, Green #48BB78) - Compliant
Examples:
1. Clear Opt-In
   "Use facial recognition? YES / NO"
   Icon: Two equal buttons, clear choice
   User choice: Affirmative action required
   Legal: COMPLIANT (Article 7)

2. Genuine Alternatives
   "Facial ID (instant) OR Paper ID (5 min) OR Manual check (free)"
   Icon: Three equal paths, no hierarchy
   User choice: All options equally viable
   Legal: COMPLIANT (Article 7)

3. Granular Controls
   "Security: Yes/No. Analytics: Yes/No. Marketing: Yes/No"
   Icon: Separate toggle switches
   User choice: Separate consent per purpose
   Legal: COMPLIANT (Article 9)

4. Plain Language
   "We scan your face at entry. Not saved. Not for marketing."
   Icon: Clear text, checkmarks
   User choice: User understands implications
   Legal: COMPLIANT (Article 9)

5. Easy Withdrawal
   "Turn off biometrics anytime (settings, 30 seconds)"
   Icon: One-click toggle, unlocked
   User choice: Can change mind without friction
   Legal: COMPLIANT (Article 7)

## COLOR ZONES (Gradient)

Left (Coercive): Red #FF6B6B (restrictive, oppressive feel)
  Icons: Locks, prohibition, single path
  Visual: Dark, closed, no alternatives

Middle (Problematic): Amber #ED8936 (transitional, warning feel)
  Icons: Question marks, warnings, unclear paths
  Visual: Unclear choice, friction required

Right (Voluntary): Green #48BB78 (open, accessible feel)
  Icons: Checkmarks, multiple open paths, unlock
  Visual: Bright, expansive, choice visible

Horizontal spectrum (left=coercive, center=problematic, right=voluntary), color gradient, real consent design patterns, GDPR Article 7 and 9 principles, festival entry/consent scenarios
