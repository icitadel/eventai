# When "Security" Becomes Surveillance: AI Misuse in Live Events

The live events industry has repeatedly deployed AI systems under beneficial pretenses—security, convenience, fair pricing—only to cause documented privacy violations, discrimination, and consumer harm. **Six major verified cases from 2020-2025** illustrate how technology framed as helpful has backfired on festival-goers and concert attendees, drawing regulatory action and widespread condemnation.

## Madison Square Garden weaponized facial recognition against lawyers

The most egregious documented case involves MSG Entertainment's systematic use of facial recognition to ban attorneys whose law firms had litigation against the company—regardless of whether the individual attorneys worked on those cases.

**Technology and stated purpose:** MSG deployed facial recognition cameras at venue entrances beginning in 2018, claiming the system enhanced "security" by identifying banned individuals. The company scraped photos from law firm websites to build a watchlist database covering attorneys at 90+ NYC-area firms.

**What actually happened:** Starting in fall 2022, attorneys began being identified and ejected from events they had purchased tickets to attend:

- **November 2022:** Kelly Conlon, an attorney at Davis, Saperstein & Solomon, was removed from Radio City Music Hall's Christmas Spectacular while chaperoning her daughter's Girl Scout troop. Her firm was suing an MSG-owned restaurant—Conlon personally had no involvement in the case.
- **October 2022:** Larry Hutcher, a 45-year Knicks season ticket holder, had his tickets revoked after his firm filed litigation against MSG. The ban extended to all attorneys at his firm.
- **December 2022:** Nicolette Landi was barred from a Mariah Carey concert (a birthday gift) because her firm represented a client suing MSG.

**Regulatory response:** New York Attorney General Letitia James launched an investigation in January 2023, warning the policy potentially violated New York Civil Rights Law. The New York State Liquor Authority initiated proceedings to revoke MSG's liquor license. Multiple class actions were filed alleging violations of NYC's Biometric Identifier Information Code.

**Legal outcome:** A federal judge dismissed the class action in May 2024, finding MSG did not directly "profit" from biometric data under existing city law—while calling the practice "objectionable." Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick described MSG's policy as "presumptively vindictive."

**Documented harm:** The policy chilled attorneys from accepting legitimate cases against MSG, potentially affecting employment discrimination, sexual harassment, and personal injury victims seeking legal representation.

## Ticketmaster's "Verified Fan" enabled the scalpers it promised to stop

Ticketmaster's AI-powered Verified Fan system, marketed as identifying "real humans" while "weeding out bots," spectacularly failed during the Taylor Swift Eras Tour presale—and federal investigations later revealed the company actively facilitated the very scalping it claimed to prevent.

**Technology and stated purpose:** Verified Fan uses AI-based verification through Ticketmaster accounts, email addresses, and phone numbers to purportedly ensure legitimate fans get tickets before resellers. The system promised "shorter waits and smoother on-sales."

**What actually happened during the November 2022 Taylor Swift presale:**
- **3.5 billion system requests** overwhelmed infrastructure within one hour
- Website crashed, logging out users mid-purchase and freezing queues for hours
- Only **1.5 million of 3.5 million registrants** received purchase codes
- General public sale was cancelled entirely on November 17
- Bot attacks successfully bypassed the "Verified Fan" access codes

**FTC investigation revelations (September 2025):** The FTC lawsuit exposed that Ticketmaster "tacitly worked" with scalpers, deliberately turning "a blind eye as a matter of policy" to broker violations. Internal documents showed:
- Just **5 brokers controlled 6,345 Ticketmaster accounts** with 246,407 tickets to 2,594 events
- One broker purchased **772 tickets to a single Coldplay concert** for $81,000, reselling them for $170,000+
- Over **9,000 tickets** purchased by one broker for a single Beyoncé Renaissance tour night
- The company provided "TradeDesk" software specifically to high-volume resellers
- An internal finding noted one verification feature was "too effective" at stopping brokers—and was rejected to protect revenue

**Regulatory actions:**
- **May 2024:** DOJ filed antitrust lawsuit (40 state attorneys general joined) seeking structural breakup of Live Nation/Ticketmaster
- **September 2025:** FTC filed consumer protection lawsuit (7 state AGs joined) for deceptive pricing and BOTS Act violations
- **January 2023:** Senate Judiciary Committee hearing featured witnesses unanimously calling Ticketmaster a "monopoly"

**Documented consumer harm:** The FTC documented **$16.4 billion in hidden fees** extracted from consumers (2019-2024), with mandatory fees adding 24-44% above advertised prices. ADA violations occurred when non-disabled purchasers accidentally bought accessible seating that venues failed to restrict.

## Oasis ticket prices doubled while fans waited in queue

The August 2024 Oasis reunion ticket sale demonstrated how AI-driven pricing systems can exploit consumers in real-time, prompting the UK Competition and Markets Authority to investigate potential consumer law violations.

**Technology and stated purpose:** Ticketmaster deployed tiered pricing (initially reported as "dynamic pricing") for the 17-date UK/Ireland reunion tour. The company claimed such systems "help keep general ticket prices down" and "reduce touting."

**What actually happened:** On August 31, 2024:
- Standing tickets advertised at **£135-148 jumped to £355+** while fans remained in multi-hour queues
- Some tickets reached **£466 before fees** (from £100 advertised)
- No advance warning was provided that prices could surge
- UK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy paid **£350 each**—double the advertised price
- Oasis claimed Liam and Noel Gallagher "didn't know" the pricing system would be used

**Regulatory response:** The UK CMA launched a formal investigation in September 2024, examining whether consumers received "clear and timely information" about pricing. In September 2025, Ticketmaster agreed to voluntary commitments including 24-hour advance notice before using tiered pricing and informing queue participants of price ranges.

**Consequence:** Oasis opted out of dynamic/tiered pricing entirely for subsequent North American ticket sales. The incident prompted UK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy to pledge a governmental review of dynamic pricing practices.

## Taylor Swift's Rose Bowl concert deployed covert facial recognition on fans

A 2018 concert exemplifies how surveillance technology can be deployed without attendee knowledge under the guise of artist protection—raising questions that remain relevant as the same practices continue at venues today.

**Technology and stated purpose:** ISM Connect, an event marketing and security company, installed a facial recognition kiosk at Taylor Swift's May 18, 2018 Rose Bowl concert. The stated purpose was identifying Swift's "hundreds of known stalkers" for security.

**What actually happened:** A display showing rehearsal videos was positioned to attract fans. A hidden camera inside the kiosk scanned faces of anyone who stopped to watch. Images were transmitted to a "command post" in Nashville—approximately 2,000 miles away—where they were cross-referenced against a database of known stalkers.

**Privacy violations documented:**
- **No notice** provided to the approximately 60,000 attendees that facial recognition was active
- **No consent obtained** for biometric data collection
- Unknown whether images were stored, shared with third parties, or monetized
- No public information on whether any actual stalkers were identified

**Industry impact:** This case contributed to California strengthening biometric privacy laws. The Rose Bowl later confirmed it "relies on facial recognition technology" at all events. ISM Connect's CEO told Rolling Stone they were "comfortable with the solution," dismissing privacy concerns.

## UK police facial recognition at concerts yielded 98% false matches

Police deployment of facial recognition at concerts, festivals, and cultural events across the UK produced documented error rates so high that advocacy groups characterized it as mass surveillance of innocent people.

**Technology and stated purpose:** South Wales Police, Metropolitan Police, and other UK forces deployed live facial recognition (LFR) at events including concerts, the Notting Hill Carnival, and sporting events to identify terrorists, criminals, and security threats.

**What actually happened:**
- Metropolitan Police systems achieved **less than 2% accuracy**—102 innocent people incorrectly flagged, only 2 correct identifications, zero arrests
- South Wales Police achieved only **9% accuracy**—91% of matches were innocent people
- At the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff, **over 90% of matches** were incorrect
- Big Brother Watch documented that **95% of total "matches" across UK police forces wrongly identified innocent people**

**Discriminatory impact documented:**
- Black men comprised the **largest proportion of people wrongly flagged**
- Majority of misidentifications affected young Black boys and children
- Technology deployed at Notting Hill Carnival—a celebration of Black Caribbean heritage—drew particular criticism

**Legal outcome:** In **R (Bridges) v South Wales Police** (August 2020), the UK Court of Appeal ruled police facial recognition use **unlawful** on three grounds: breach of Article 8 ECHR (right to privacy), failure to conduct adequate Data Protection Impact Assessment, and failure to meet Public Sector Equality Duty regarding discrimination risks. The court found police had "impermissibly wide" discretion and "fundamental deficiencies" in legal frameworks.

**Documented harm:** The technology was deployed at peaceful protests (including an arms fair demonstration), creating chilling effects on democratic participation. In December 2024, National Physical Laboratory analysis confirmed racial bias in the Police National Database: false positive rates of **0.04% for white subjects versus 5.5% for Black subjects**.

## The Ticketmaster breach exposed 560 million concert-goers

The largest data breach in live entertainment history demonstrated how AI-powered systems that collect massive consumer data create correspondingly massive security vulnerabilities.

**Technology and stated purpose:** Ticketmaster's cloud-based infrastructure (via third-party provider Snowflake) stored comprehensive customer data to power personalization, account management, and the Verified Fan system.

**What actually happened:** Between April 2 and May 18, 2024, the hacking group "ShinyHunters" exfiltrated **1.3 terabytes of data** affecting approximately **560 million users**. Stolen information included:
- Full names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers
- Partial payment card data (last 4 digits, expiration dates)
- Complete ticket purchase histories
- Hashed account passwords

The data was offered for sale on the dark web for $500,000. Taylor Swift Eras Tour barcodes were specifically targeted. Ticketmaster waited **51 days** before notifying affected customers in July 2024.

**Regulatory response:** Live Nation disclosed the breach in an SEC filing on May 31, 2024. Canadian authorities arrested suspect Alexander "Connor" Moucka in late 2024. Multiple class actions were filed alleging negligence and unjust enrichment.

**Consumer harm:** The breach exposed concert-goers to ongoing identity theft risk. Ticketmaster offered 12 months of identity monitoring—inadequate for permanent exposure of personal information.

## Biometric collection at venues faces mounting regulatory pressure

The **UK ICO fined Ticketmaster UK £1.25 million** in November 2020 after a third-party chatbot breach exposed payment data of 9.4 million EEA customers. The ICO found Ticketmaster failed to implement a "layered approach to security" and hadn't vetted the vendor since 2013—five years prior.

**Illinois BIPA continues generating significant entertainment industry settlements:** Six Flags paid **$36 million** (2021) after the Illinois Supreme Court ruled in *Rosenbach v. Six Flags* that no actual injury is required to sue over biometric violations. The **Chicago Cubs face a pending BIPA lawsuit** over facial recognition at Wrigley Field deployed without fan consent.

**Clearview AI**, whose facial recognition database has been used by law enforcement at events, has faced cumulative **GDPR fines exceeding €90.5 million** from Dutch, French, Italian, Greek, and UK regulators for unlawful processing of biometric data scraped from the internet. A March 2025 class action settlement valued Clearview's liability at **$51.75 million**.

## How artists and activists successfully blocked some deployments

Not all surveillance expansions have proceeded unchallenged. When AXS announced **Amazon One palm scanning** at Red Rocks Amphitheater in September 2021, **300+ artists** including Tom Morello, Kathleen Hanna, and Jeff Rosenstock signed an open letter demanding cancellation. They warned the system created "hotspots for police harassment and stolen identities." By March 2022, Denver Arts and Venues confirmed the partnership was abandoned.

**100+ artists** have pledged to boycott venues using facial recognition, including members of Rage Against the Machine, Bikini Kill, and Anti-Flag. **40+ major festivals** including Coachella, Bonnaroo, and SXSW committed not to deploy facial recognition following Fight for the Future campaigns.

---

## Regulatory frameworks remain fragmented

The documented cases reveal significant gaps in consumer protection. **No federal biometric privacy law exists in the United States**—only Illinois (BIPA), Texas, and Washington have state-level protections. Most states permit private venues to conduct unlimited surveillance without consent. NYC requires disclosure signage but not affirmative consent, which is why MSG could legally operate its lawyer ban despite public condemnation.

The **EU AI Act** (effective 2024-2025) restricts real-time biometric identification in public spaces, but implementation varies. The UK has no specific facial recognition legislation despite the *Bridges* court ruling finding existing frameworks inadequate.

**Executive Order 14254** (March 2025), titled "Combating Unfair Practices in the Live Entertainment Market," directed the FTC to rigorously enforce the BOTS Act and ordered a joint DOJ/FTC inquiry into industry practices—signaling increased federal attention.

## Conclusion: The pattern persists

These cases share a common thread: AI systems marketed under beneficial framing—security, convenience, fairness, personalization—consistently produced outcomes that harmed the consumers they purportedly served. Madison Square Garden's "security" system became a tool for corporate retaliation. Ticketmaster's "bot prevention" facilitated industrial-scale scalping. Dynamic pricing "to fight touts" doubled costs for fans mid-queue. Festival facial recognition deployed for "stalker protection" operated without consent or oversight.

The pattern mirrors the Target pregnancy prediction case: sophisticated AI systems collecting data under one justification, deployed for purposes consumers never anticipated or approved. **The key difference is scale**—560 million exposed records, 98% false positive rates, billions in hidden fees—and the intimate context of live entertainment, where attendees reasonably expect to enjoy concerts and festivals without becoming subjects of mass biometric surveillance or algorithmic price manipulation.

For consumers, the lesson is clear: beneficial framing does not guarantee beneficial outcomes. The live events industry's AI deployments demonstrate that without robust regulation, transparency requirements, and meaningful consent mechanisms, technology positioned as serving audiences will instead extract maximum value from them.
