# Five Core Interview Questions: AI in Live Events Industry

**Purpose**: Expert interview guide for developing consumer-oriented textbook content on AI in festivals and live events.

**Interview Structure**: These questions are designed to elicit expert insights across five critical dimensions of AI adoption in the live events sector, drawing on industry trends, educational needs, innovation examples, ethical considerations, and operational applications.

## Question 1: Long-term AI Future Vision

**In your view, what is the ultimate, long-term future of AI in the festival and live events industry over the next decade? What will be the most significant, visible difference between a non-AI-driven event and an AI-optimized event for the average attendee?**

**Context**: This question explores forecasts and transformative changes in attendee-facing experiences, drawing on industry reports, festival innovation initiatives, and expert predictions about how AI will fundamentally reshape the live events landscape.

## Question 2: Critical AI Literacy in Education

**For university students pursuing degrees in event management, why is learning about AI not just about using the tools (functional literacy), but also about understanding its ethical, economic, and philosophical implications (critical literacy)?**

**Context**: This question addresses the gap between AI tool proficiency and deeper critical understanding, examining why event management education must go beyond technical skills to include ethical reasoning, social justice dimensions, and systemic implications of AI deployment.

## Question 3: Innovative On-Site Personalization

**AI can personalize the attendee journey (e.g., personalized schedules, content recommendations). What is the most innovative example you have seen of AI being used on-site at a large festival to enhance the individual fan experience in a way that feels organic and non-intrusive?**

**Context**: This question seeks real-world, deployed examples of AI systems that create personalized experiences while maintaining the spontaneous, serendipitous character of live events. Focus on systems that feel embedded in natural behaviors rather than intrusive or surveillance-oriented.

## Question 4: Surveillance Ethics and Privacy Risks

**With the use of AI for real-time crowd movement analysis, facial recognition, and sentiment tracking, what are the primary ethical and data privacy risks festival organizers must address to use these tools for security and safety responsibly?**

**Context**: This question examines consent, data retention, misidentification, function creep, and chilling effects associated with AI surveillance technologies. It asks experts to articulate the balance between safety imperatives and civil liberties, informed by documented incidents and regulatory frameworks.

## Question 5: Real-Time Predictive Analytics for Operations

**Festivals often operate on razor-thin margins. How is AI moving beyond simple historical analysis to enable genuine, real-time predictive analytics that festival organizers can use to forecast ticket demand, dynamically set pricing, and accurately allocate resources like food, beverage, and staffing?**

**Context**: This question focuses on deployed AI systems with documented performance metrics in high-stakes, margin-sensitive operations. It seeks to distinguish between trend speculation and actual implementations with measurable ROI in areas like dynamic pricing, staffing optimization, inventory forecasting, and crowd flow management.

## Interview Guidelines

**For Interviewer Mode:**
- Ask questions one at a time
- Allow for follow-up probes based on initial responses
- Reference specific examples from research briefing when relevant
- Note when expert responses align with or diverge from documented evidence

**For Researcher Mode:**
- Extract and analyze expert responses against existing research
- Identify novel insights vs. confirmation of known findings
- Flag gaps or contradictions for further investigation

**For Assistant Mode:**
- Provide fact-checking support during interviews
- Surface relevant citations from research briefing
- Clarify technical terms or frameworks as needed
