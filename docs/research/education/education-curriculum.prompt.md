## Research Questions

### Primary Question
What event management, hospitality, or tourism higher education programs have integrated AI literacy (functional or critical) into curricula as of 2024-2025?

### Specific Sub-Questions

1. **Program Identification:** Which universities offer AI literacy in event/hospitality programs?
   - Program names (e.g., "Cornell School of Hotel Administration")
   - Course titles (e.g., "AI in Hospitality Operations," "Critical Thinking in Event Technology")
   - Required vs. elective status
   - Undergraduate vs. graduate level

2. **Curriculum Content:** What do they actually teach?
   - Course syllabi (if publicly available)
   - Learning objectives
   - Distinction between functional (tool use) vs. critical (ethical evaluation) literacy
   - Event-specific vs. general AI content

3. **Assessment Methods:** How do they measure learning?
   - Exams, projects, case studies, portfolios?
   - Rubrics for critical thinking assessment
   - Student learning outcomes data (if published)

4. **Industry Partnerships:** Are event companies collaborating with universities?
   - Named partnerships (e.g., "Eventbrite + UNLV")
   - Guest lectures from industry practitioners
   - Internship programs with AI components
   - Industry-funded research or curriculum development

5. **Empirical Outcomes:** Is there data on effectiveness?
   - Peer-reviewed studies on AI literacy in hospitality education
   - Student performance metrics
   - Graduate employment outcomes related to AI skills

## Context: What We Already Know

**From Initial Research:**
- **U. Florida QEP:** General AI literacy (not event-specific); all students required
- **Harvard Embedded EthiCS:** Computer science focus (not hospitality)
- **EthAI Tour:** Student-led initiative (not formal curriculum)
- **UNESCO AI Competency Framework:** K-12 and general higher ed (not event management)

**Gaps:**
- ZERO event management-specific curriculum data
- Cannot confidently claim event programs are preparing students without evidence
- Don't know if programs teach functional only, critical only, or both
- No empirical data on whether AI literacy training improves event professional competency

## Special Handling

### If Event Management Data is Sparse:

**Acceptable extrapolation (clearly marked):**
- Hospitality programs teaching AI (hotels, restaurants) → likely transferable to events
- Tourism programs teaching AI (destination management) → some overlap with event planning

**Required caveat in .research.md:**
"Event management-specific AI curriculum data is limited. The following findings from hospitality and tourism programs suggest transferable approaches, but direct event management validation is needed."

### If No Programs Found:

**DO NOT invent programs.** Instead, state:
"Despite extensive search of major event management programs in US, UK, EU, and Australia, no publicly available AI literacy curricula specific to event planning were identified as of December 2025. This represents a significant curriculum gap given industry AI adoption rates."

## Quality Control

### Before Submitting Research:

- [ ] Minimum 3 programs identified (or gap explicitly noted)
- [ ] At least 1 course syllabus or detailed learning objectives (or note unavailable)
- [ ] Functional vs. critical literacy distinction applied
- [ ] Industry partnerships documented (or note absence)
- [ ] Peer-reviewed outcomes research included (or gap noted)
- [ ] 20-25 sources catalogued
- [ ] Extrapolation from hospitality clearly marked

---

## Escalation Triggers

**Flag for Research Lead if:**
- Zero event management programs found (may need to substantially revise Education draft claims)
- Programs exist but are purely functional (no critical literacy) → changes framework
- Strong empirical evidence that AI literacy training is ineffective (contradicts premise)
