**Source:** `initial/eventai-education.md` + `external/unesco-ai-competency-fx.pdf`
**Analyst:** Claude Code
**Date:** 2025-12-27
**Status:** Synthesis Complete - Ready for Drafting

⚠️ **ESCALATION NOTE:** Limited event management-specific curriculum data. Draft will extrapolate from general higher education AI literacy research with explicit limitations stated.

## Executive Summary

Event management students require **critical AI literacy**—not just tool proficiency—because they will deploy systems that encode power relationships, embed biases, and impact civil liberties in public-facing contexts. The distinction between **functional literacy** (how to use AI tools) and **critical literacy** (understanding whose interests AI serves, how it embeds values, and its unequal impacts) is foundational to responsible professional practice.

**Key Finding:** Current AI education trends are shifting TOWARD functional literacy (post-GenAI tool adoption) and AWAY FROM critical examination—creating "research gaps in promoting critical literacy surrounding AI tools" (Gu & Ericson, 2025). Event management education must resist this trend due to the field's unique characteristics: public-facing deployments, diverse stakeholder impacts, and real-time decision environments.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (60-80%)
**Evidence Quality:** Strong theoretical frameworks, verified implementation models, thin event management-specific data
**Critical Gap:** No empirical data on current state of AI literacy in event management curricula

## Theme 1: Defining the Two Literacies

### Functional AI Literacy (Skills-Based)
**Definition:** "A set of competencies that enables individuals to critically evaluate AI technologies; communicate and collaborate effectively with AI; and use AI as a tool online, at home, and in the workplace." (Long & Magerko, 2020)

**Core Questions Addressed:**
- *How does AI work?*
- *What can AI do?*

**Competencies:**
- Prompt engineering
- Data input and output interpretation
- Tool selection for specific tasks
- System operation and troubleshooting

**Framework Mapping (Ng et al., 2021):**
- "Know and Understand AI"
- "Use and Apply AI"

**EDUCAUSE Framework:**
- "Technical" competencies
- "Practical" competencies

**Confidence:** HIGH (>85%) - well-established frameworks

### Critical AI Literacy (Evaluative & Ethical)
**Definition:** "Understanding whose interests AI serves, how algorithmic systems embed particular values, and how AI impacts different communities unequally" (synthesis of Velander et al., 2024; UNESCO, 2024)

**Core Questions Addressed:**
- *Whose interests does this AI serve?*
- *How does this system embed values?*
- *Who benefits and who bears costs?*
- *What are alternatives to current practices?*

**Competencies:**
- Algorithmic bias detection and auditing
- Ethical framework application (welfare, justice, respect)
- Stakeholder impact analysis
- Power dynamic interrogation
- Systemic consequences evaluation

**Framework Mapping (Ng et al., 2021):**
- "Evaluate and Create AI"
- "AI Ethics"

**EDUCAUSE Framework:**
- "Evaluative" competencies
- "Ethical" competencies

**UNESCO AI Competency Framework (2024):**
- "Human-centred mindset"
- "Ethics of AI"
- Requirement: "Critically assess AI to ensure it enhances learning and promotes inclusivity and equity"

**Confidence:** HIGH (>85%) - peer-reviewed frameworks + UNESCO policy

### The Shift Away From Critical Literacy (Concerning Trend)
**Finding:** Since generative AI emergence, research has shifted toward post-secondary settings with "a functional literacy perspective," creating "research gaps in promoting critical literacy surrounding AI tools" (Gu & Ericson, 2025)

**Implication:** Event management education must intentionally counter this trend
**Confidence:** MEDIUM (recent integrative review, limited sample)

## Theme 2: Five Reasons Critical Literacy is Essential for Event Students

### Reason 1: Event Managers Deploy Systems Encoding Power Relationships
**Example:** Taylor Swift 2018 Rose Bowl concert
- Facial recognition scanned ~60,000 attendees
- Matched against stalker database
- No disclosure, consent, or published retention policy
- ACLU: "As long as it's private property, they can take your image and do whatever analytics they want"

**Critical Literacy Need:**
- Functional literacy: How to implement facial recognition systems
- **Critical literacy:** Whether to implement, for whom, under what accountability

**Ethical Question:** Who has authority to surveil public gatherings without consent?
**Professional Responsibility:** Event managers become arbiters of surveillance ethics

**Confidence:** HIGH (documented incident, legal analysis, civil rights org statements)

### Reason 2: Algorithmic Bias Reproduces Discrimination
**Hospitality-Specific Evidence:**
"Algorithmic personalisation has resulted in poor service experiences for users with less common language or identity characteristics" through digital redlining (Zhou et al., 2022)

**Facial Recognition Bias (Applicable to Event Security):**
- Amazon Rekognition: **40% false matches** of Congress members as criminals were people of color (20% of sample)
- Bias detectable only through critical analysis, not functional operation

**Professional Gap:**
- Functional literacy: Operate facial recognition at entry points
- **Critical literacy:** Audit for racial disparities, understand legal implications, recognize reputational risks

**Confidence:** HIGH (peer-reviewed hospitality research, ACLU documented testing)

### Reason 3: Labor Automation Requires Understanding Systemic Impacts
**Projection:** Automated systems could replace **up to 70% of hospitality tasks** (Tuomi et al., 2020)

**Distributional Consequences:**
"Automation tends to impact jobs that involve routine tasks, which are often held by Black and Latino or Hispanic workers" (Barr & Meeks, 2025)

**Critical Literacy Need:**
- Functional literacy: Select and deploy automation tools
- **Critical literacy:** Understand who benefits (cost savings) and who bears costs (job displacement)

**Professional Responsibility:** Technology adoption decisions have justice implications beyond efficiency

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (projection + labor research; event-specific data thin)

### Reason 4: Vendor Lock-In Creates Long-Term Risks
**Vendor Dependency Issues:**
- Proprietary data formats prevent migration
- Long-term contracts with termination penalties
- Skill dependencies limit organizational flexibility
- Power asymmetry in platform relationships

**Economic Impact:**
UK Cabinet Office: Overreliance on single cloud providers could cost public bodies **£894 million**

**Critical Literacy Need:**
- Functional literacy: Use vendor platforms effectively
- **Critical literacy:** Assess data portability, exit strategies, contract implications BEFORE signing

**Professional Gap:** Evaluate long-term risks, not just short-term convenience

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (general IT governance; event-specific examples thin)

### Reason 5: AI Failures at Events Are Immediately Visible
**Public Visibility Characteristics:**
- Live events = real-time operation
- Mistakes cannot be "undone" (wrongful entry denial happens in public)
- Social amplification (TikTok, Twitter viral spread)
- Reputational consequences immediate

**Documented Failures:**
- **McDonald's AI drive-thru:** Went viral on TikTok before IBM partnership terminated (2024)
- **Air Canada chatbot:** Provided incorrect refund info; company held legally liable

**Event-Specific Risk:**
Wrongful denial of entry based on faulty facial recognition or discriminatory recommendation algorithm operates IN PUBLIC VIEW

**Critical Literacy Need:**
- Functional literacy: Implement AI systems
- **Critical literacy:** Recognize failure modes, understand liability, develop skepticism toward confident AI outputs

**Confidence:** HIGH (documented failures) for general principle; MEDIUM for event-specific application

## Theme 3: Theoretical Foundations (Critical Pedagogy)

### Paulo Freire: Banking vs. Problem-Posing Education
**"Banking Education" Critique:**
Students as passive depositories for teacher-transmitted content

**Applied to AI:**
Teaching tool operation without critical examination = programming students "into conformity to the logic of [the] system" (Shaull, foreword to *Pedagogy of the Oppressed*)

**"Problem-Posing Education" Alternative:**
Students as co-creators of knowledge who develop critical consciousness to "perceive social, political, and economic oppression and take action against oppressive elements of society" (Freire, 1970)

**AI Education Application (Farag et al., 2021):**
"Freire 2.0: Pedagogy of the Digitally Oppressed"
- "Banking of education may refer to digital literacies"
- "Education of the digitally oppressed due to increasing penetration of AI technology and threats it poses related to discrimination and inequalities"

**Pedagogical Implication:**
Event students must not simply accept vendor claims or efficiency narratives but develop capacity for independent evaluation

**Confidence:** HIGH (foundational pedagogical theory)

### Jack Mezirow: Transformative Learning Theory
**Core Principle:**
"Critical and autonomous thinking must take precedence over the uncritical assimilation of knowledge" (Mezirow, 1997)

**Application:**
"In contemporary societies we must learn to make our own interpretations rather than act on the purposes, beliefs, judgments, and feelings of others"

**Event Management Implication:**
Graduates must independently evaluate vendor claims, not accept them uncritically

**Examples:**
- Vendor: "Our AI increases engagement 93%"
- **Critical question:** What is baseline? How measured? Who benefits? What's excluded from metric?

**Confidence:** HIGH (established learning theory)

### UNESCO Policy Framework
**Source:** UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (2021)
**Adoption:** Unanimous by 193 Member States

**Educational Mandate:**
"Public awareness and understanding of AI technologies should be promoted through open and accessible education, civic engagement, AI ethics training etc., so that people can take informed decisions regarding their use of AI systems"

**Policy Status:** Critical AI literacy = international educational policy expectation, not academic preference

**Confidence:** HIGH (official UNESCO policy document)

---

## Theme 4: Risks of Omitting Critical Literacy

### Risk 1: Unexamined Algorithmic Bias
**Documentation:** "Algorithmic decision-making creates opacity, where users are aware that they were treated unfavourably but have no way to understand that treatment" (Sailesh, 2024, *Events and Tourism Review*)

**Professional Gap:**
Event manager cannot audit recommendation algorithms or attendee profiling for discriminatory patterns

**Consequences:**
- Unknowing deployment of technology violating anti-discrimination principles
- Reputational damage when bias exposed
- Legal liability

**Confidence:** HIGH (peer-reviewed event management research)

### Risk 2: Uninformed Vendor Decisions
**Without Critical Frameworks:**
Cannot evaluate data ownership, portability, exit costs

**Result:**
Commit to technology ecosystems that extract value while providing diminishing returns

**Example:** UK Cabinet Office £894M estimate for cloud provider lock-in

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (general IT governance principle)

### Risk 3: Ethical Blind Spots in Surveillance
**Regulatory Gap:**
"There is little to no regulation in place regarding [facial recognition] use in event venues" (NY State Bar Association, 2024)

**Professional Requirement:**
Exercise independent ethical judgment in regulatory vacuum

**Gap Created by Functional-Only Training:**
Lack conceptual resources to make ethical judgments beyond technical implementation

**Confidence:** HIGH (legal analysis documents regulatory gap)

### Risk 4: Reputational Harm from AI Failures
**Example:** IBM Watson for Oncology
- $4 billion investment
- Failed due to "erroneous treatment advice" and poor data quality
- Demonstrates: AI confidence ≠ accuracy

**Professional Skill Gap:**
Functional literacy: Implement Watson
**Critical literacy:** Recognize AI confidence doesn't equal accuracy; develop skepticism

**Confidence:** HIGH (documented IBM failure widely reported)

**Gap:** General instrument, not discipline-specific

### Open University Rubric Framework
**Assessment Dimensions:**
- "Consider AI's ethical, societal and environmental impacts"
- "Consider the agency of AI (control and power dynamics)"

**Application:** Rubric-based assessment of critical thinking

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (framework published; validation studies limited)

---

## Theme 7: Practical Integration Strategies

### Strategy 1: Embedded Module Integration
**Model:** Harvard distributed pedagogy
**Implementation:**
- 50-75 minute ethics discussions within existing event technology courses
- Example: Event registration software session + algorithmic personalization ethics analysis
- Example: Facial recognition instruction + Taylor Swift case study + ACLU bias documentation

**Advantage:** Signals ethics is integral to practice, not separate concern
**Confidence:** HIGH (proven Harvard model)

### Strategy 2: Case Study Methodology
**Documented Failures for Analysis:**
- McDonald's chatbot TikTok failures → IBM partnership termination
- Air Canada legal liability for incorrect chatbot advice
- Amazon Rekognition documented bias (law enforcement context → venue security application)

**Analytical Framework:**
Students analyze through lenses of stakeholder welfare, justice, respect; propose alternatives

**Confidence:** HIGH (documented cases available)

### Strategy 3: Reflective Assessment Design
**Components:**
- Portfolios comparing learner-generated vs. AI outputs
- Reflection logs noting ethical tensions in practical applications
- Policy memos proposing governance frameworks for specific event AI deployments

**Model:** University of Chicago Harris School course design
**Confidence:** MEDIUM (model exists; event management adaptation not documented)

## Critical Gaps & Limitations

### Gap 1: No Event Management Curriculum Data
**What's Missing:**
- Current state of AI literacy in event management programs
- How many programs address AI at all
- Functional vs. critical balance in existing courses
- Student learning outcomes from implemented programs

**What We Have:**
- General higher education frameworks (Long & Magerko, Ng et al.)
- Hospitality program at U. Florida (exists but outcomes unpublished)
- CS education models (Harvard)

**Implication:**
Must extrapolate from general education to event management; state assumptions explicitly

**Confidence Impact:** Reduces from HIGH to MEDIUM for event management claims

### Gap 2: Implementation Barriers Undocumented
**What's Missing:**
- Faculty training needs (how to teach AI ethics without technical background)
- Resource requirements (faculty time, curriculum redesign costs)
- Institutional resistance factors

**What We Have:**
- Successful models exist (Harvard, U. Florida)
- But: how they overcame barriers not documented

**Implication:**
Can describe what to do, not how to overcome obstacles

### Gap 3: Industry Readiness Unknown
**What's Missing:**
- Do event organizations value critical literacy in hiring?
- Do employers seek functional-only skills?
- What's ROI for students investing in critical education?

**What We Have:**
- Theoretical arguments for importance
- Policy frameworks (UNESCO)
- But: labor market demand data absent

**Implication:**
Argument rests on professional responsibility, not demonstrated market demand

### Gap 4: Outcome Evidence Thin
**What's Missing:**
- Empirical studies showing critical literacy improves professional practice
- Long-term graduate tracking
- Comparative studies (critical literacy cohort vs. functional-only)

**What We Have:**
- Established pedagogical theory (Freire, Mezirow)
- Validated assessment instruments (SNAIL, AILS)
- Program existence (U. Florida)

**Implication:**

## Recommendations for Draft Content

### Framing Strategy
**Lead with the distinction:** Functional vs. Critical (clear definitions + examples)
**Establish stakes:** Five reasons framework with event-specific justifications
**Ground in theory:** Freire + Mezirow + UNESCO (accessible explanations)
**Show how:** Integration models (embedded, case study, reflective)

### Evidence Handling
**Use Tier 1 for definitions** (Long & Magerko, UNESCO)
**Use documented incidents** for event-specific examples (Taylor Swift, Amazon Rekognition bias)
**Acknowledge gaps explicitly:**
- "While event management-specific curriculum data is unavailable..."
- "Extrapolating from general higher education research..."
- "The University of Florida program exists, but outcome studies are not yet published..."

### Pedagogical Approach
**Worked examples:**
- Harvard module structure (concrete implementation model)
- Taylor Swift case through critical literacy lens (functional: implement; critical: should we?)

**Scaffolding:**
- Simple distinction (functional vs. critical) → reasons why → theoretical foundations → how to implement

**Practical focus:**
- Not "should we teach this?" but "how do we teach this effectively?"

### Consumer-Oriented Tone
- Avoid: "Praxis," "epistemological," "hegemonic structures" (unless defined)
- Use: Concrete examples (Taylor Swift scanning 60K fans), clear consequences (legal liability, bias)
- Connect: Why this matters to YOU as future event professional
