4. **sources.md** - Full bibliography with verification status

## Source Materials

- Initial research: `../initial/eventai-education.md`
- External: `../external/unesco-ai-competency-fx.pdf` (authoritative framework)
- See Phase 1 inventory: `../p1-source-inventory.md` (Education section)

## Status

- [ ] P2.2.1: Extract & Synthesize Research
- [ ] P2.2.2: Draft Section Content
- [ ] P2.2.3: Quality Self-Check
- [ ] GATE P2.2: Topic Review (human approval)

## Notes

**Gap identified:** Limited event management-specific curriculum data. May need to extrapolate from general higher education AI literacy research. Frame limitations explicitly.
