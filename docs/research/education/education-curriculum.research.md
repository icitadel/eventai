# AI Literacy in Hospitality and Tourism Education: A Curriculum Gap Analysis

Event management programs have not systematically integrated AI literacy into their curricula despite accelerating industry adoption of AI tools. This comprehensive review of **12 universities across the US, UK, and Australia** reveals that only **three programs** explicitly address AI in course content, with hospitality and tourism programs significantly ahead of event management in technology integration. **Critical AI literacy—covering ethics, bias, and societal impacts—remains virtually absent** from all programs examined.

The gap between industry AI adoption and academic preparation is stark: a 2024 UK study found that **71% of hospitality organizations report AI/robotics skills gaps**, yet only 3% use higher education for digital training. Professional organizations like MPI and PCMA have responded faster than universities, launching dedicated AI certificates in 2023-2024 that have trained over 3,500 event professionals.

## Three programs explicitly integrate AI into hospitality curricula

Among 12 priority universities examined, only three demonstrate explicit AI or automation content in their degree programs. **University of Surrey leads with the most comprehensive integration**, featuring AI explicitly named in undergraduate learning outcomes and a dedicated research center focused on digital transformation.

| University | Program | Course/Module | Level | Status | AI Content Type |
|------------|---------|---------------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| University of Surrey | BSc International Tourism/Hospitality/Event Management | Visitor Attraction Management (MAN2220) | Undergraduate | Optional for Event Mgmt; Compulsory for Tourism | VR, AR, AI applications |
| University of Surrey | MSc Programs | Smart Tourism and Events Design (MANM432) | Postgraduate | Core | Big data analytics, smart tourism concepts |
| Southern Cross University | Bachelor of Business in Hotel Management | Hospitality Information and Technology Systems (HOTL3006) | Undergraduate | Required | Automation and robotics, data mining |
| Penn State | MPS in Hospitality Management | Hospitality Data Analytics (HM 830) | Graduate | **Required** | Predictive analytics (implicit AI) |

**University of Surrey's Centre for Digital Transformation in the Visitor Economy (DIGMY)** represents the strongest institutional commitment to AI research applied to hospitality and events. The centre explicitly lists "Artificial intelligence and robotics in hospitality, tourism, and events" as a core research theme and employs a Senior Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work.

**Southern Cross University's HOTL3006** module includes explicit automation and robotics content with learning outcomes requiring students to "critically analyse the role of management in digital information and technology systems." This represents rare practical AI/automation curriculum in the hospitality space.

## Functional literacy dominates; critical AI literacy largely absent

The distinction between **functional AI literacy** (tool operation, practical applications) and **critical AI literacy** (ethical evaluation, bias analysis, societal impacts) reveals a significant curriculum gap. All programs examined emphasize functional approaches.

**Functional AI literacy content identified:**
- University of Surrey: VR/AR/AI tool applications, Hospitality Information Systems, data analytics lab
- Southern Cross: Automation/robotics implementation, guest-centric technologies, data mining techniques
- Penn State HM 830: Predictive analytics software, data visualization, decision support systems
- Cornell eCornell Certificate: ChatGPT applications, automation tools (Zapier, Botster), predictive modeling

**Critical AI literacy content identified:**
- University of Surrey: Ethical issues in visitor attraction management mentioned in assessment criteria
- Cornell eCornell: Brief mention of "analyzing bias in employee data" in one module
- **No other programs** include explicit content on algorithmic bias, AI ethics frameworks, data privacy implications, or societal impacts

Cornell's AI in Hospitality Certificate—the most comprehensive program identified—represents **5.5 days of executive education** covering tools like BigML, ChatGPT, and Zapier. However, this exists entirely outside degree programs, accessible only to working professionals paying premium fees. The undergraduate BS in Hotel Administration requires only HADM 1740 Business Computing (Excel, PowerPoint, Word) with no AI content.

## Event management programs trail hospitality in technology integration

**Event management-specific AI curriculum is virtually nonexistent.** While hospitality and tourism programs show emerging technology integration, event management programs focus predominantly on operational skills with minimal systematic technology education.

Leeds Beckett University's UK Centre for Events Management (UKCEM)—one of the world's largest dedicated event management programs—covers "websites and event technologies such as e-ticketing, matrix-barcodes (QR) and radio frequency identification (RFID)" but has **no dedicated AI, machine learning, or data analytics modules**. Their course handbook states students "study the importance of emerging technologies" but implementation remains embedded rather than explicit.

UCF Rosen College offers a BS in Event Management with an HFT 3443 Event Technology course, but no AI content is documented. The college has announced strategic AI initiatives through its Hospitality+ Center for Innovation and Training, including an "AI-Enhanced Guest Services Lab," but these remain research-level initiatives not yet integrated into degree curricula.

**The caveat applies:** Event management-specific AI curriculum data is severely limited. Findings from hospitality and tourism programs suggest transferable approaches, but direct event management validation is needed.

## Industry partnerships outpace academic curriculum development

Professional organizations have responded more rapidly than universities to industry AI adoption. Two major AI-specific certificates now exist:

**MPI + Reposite AI-Enhanced Event Professional Certificate** (launched November 2023):
- **500+ planners trained** through approximately 10 sessions annually
- Content: AI concepts, chatbots, predictive analytics, AI-powered event management software, personalized marketing
- 7.5 CMP clock hours; pricing $305-$405
- Classification: Primarily functional AI literacy

**PCMA Institute Enhancing Events with AI Certificate**:
- Instructor: Nick Borelli (Zenus Director of Marketing)
- Multiple sessions annually; 7.5 CMP hours; pricing $556-$695
- Content: AI platforms, marketing automation, audience engagement, logistics automation, predictive analytics

**PCMA's Project Spark**—a generative AI platform launched May 2023 in partnership with Gevme—reports **3,000+ event professionals using AI tools** for agenda development, content creation, and speaker bio generation. PCMA claims 64% of event professionals now use AI in some form.

Technology vendor partnerships are expanding but focus on platform training rather than AI literacy:
- **Cvent + Cornell/NYU**: Corporate partnerships providing student access to event management platforms
- **Oracle + Auburn University**: OPERA Cloud integration in teaching hotel curriculum
- **Amadeus Learning Partners**: Tourism distribution technology training globally

## Academic research remains conceptual with limited empirical data

The Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Education (JHTE) has announced a **Special Issue on "Artificial Intelligence in Teaching and Learning for Hospitality and Tourism Education"** for June/July 2025, signaling growing scholarly attention. However, current empirical research on AI curriculum effectiveness is sparse.

**Key peer-reviewed findings:**

A 2024 study in the Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Education surveying UK tourism/hospitality organizations found the **largest skills gaps relate to AI and robotics (71%)** and AR/VR/digital hardware (68%). Critically, only 3% of organizations use higher education for digital training, suggesting curriculum relevance concerns.

Research by Dalgıç et al. (2024) in the Journal of Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism Education found that ChatGPT affects learning outcomes in tourism education, with digital literacy serving as a mediating factor. This represents rare empirical work but used a single-country sample (Turkey).

The International Journal of Hospitality Management's 2025 special issue on AI technology includes a systematic review of 43 ChatGPT publications in tourism/hospitality through April 2024, but focuses on industry applications rather than curriculum effectiveness.

**UNESCO's AI Competency Framework for Teachers** (2024) provides a 15-competency framework across five dimensions—human-centered mindset, ethics of AI, AI foundations, AI pedagogy, and AI for professional development—that could be adapted for hospitality education but has not been systematically applied.

## Significant gaps remain in evidence and implementation

Despite extensive search across major event management, hospitality, and tourism programs in the US, UK, EU, and Australia, several critical gaps persist:

**Curriculum documentation gaps:**
- Course syllabi were not publicly available for detailed content analysis at most institutions
- Learning objectives specific to AI competencies could not be verified beyond module descriptors
- Assessment rubrics for AI-related critical thinking were not accessible

**Research gaps:**
- Zero longitudinal studies on learning outcomes from AI training in hospitality/tourism programs
- No published graduate employment outcomes data specifically linked to AI skills
- Limited cross-cultural research on AI curriculum adoption

**Implementation gaps:**
- No event management-specific AI courses identified at any institution examined
- Critical AI literacy (ethics, bias, societal impacts) absent from all but one program (Surrey, minimal)
- Generative AI applications (content creation, personalization) not addressed in any degree curriculum

---

## Confidence assessment and integration recommendations

**Overall Confidence Level: MEDIUM**

Evidence is sufficient to conclude that systematic AI literacy integration in event management/hospitality curricula is in early stages, with industry professional development leading academic programs. However, detailed curriculum content (syllabi, learning outcomes, assessment methods) could not be fully verified from public sources.

| Finding Area | Confidence | Evidence Basis |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| Program identification | HIGH | Official university catalogs, module descriptors |
| AI content classification | MEDIUM | Module descriptions; syllabi unavailable |
| Functional vs. critical distinction | HIGH | Content analysis of available descriptors |
| Industry partnerships | HIGH | Press releases, organization websites, pricing data |
| Empirical outcomes | LOW | Limited peer-reviewed research available |

**Claims the research supports:**
- Event management programs have not systematically integrated AI literacy
- Hospitality/tourism programs show emerging but limited AI content
- Industry certifications provide more accessible AI training than degree programs
- Critical AI literacy represents a significant curriculum gap
- The UK/Australia (particularly University of Surrey) leads US institutions in explicit AI curriculum

**Claims requiring caveats:**
- Specific learning outcomes and assessment methods (syllabi access limited)
- Student performance data (not publicly available)
- Employment outcomes related to AI skills (no published research found)
- Whether AI content in hospitality programs transfers effectively to event management contexts

---

## Conclusion

The hospitality and tourism education sector faces a curriculum-industry gap in AI literacy that may widen without intervention. While **University of Surrey, Southern Cross University, and Penn State** demonstrate emerging AI integration, the event management discipline specifically shows no documented AI curriculum. Professional organizations like MPI and PCMA have filled this gap through certificate programs training thousands of practitioners, but these remain separate from degree-granting programs.

The near-total absence of critical AI literacy—ethical evaluation, bias analysis, algorithmic accountability—across all programs represents perhaps the most significant finding. As AI tools like Project Spark become standard event planning resources, graduates without critical frameworks for evaluating AI outputs may face significant professional vulnerabilities. The forthcoming JHTE special issue on AI in hospitality education may catalyze academic attention, but curriculum development appears to lag industry adoption by several years.
