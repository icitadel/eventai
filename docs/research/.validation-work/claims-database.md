## MISSING SOURCE CATALOGS

**CRITICAL GAP:** None of the 5 draft documents include formal "Source Catalog" or "References" sections. All citations are inline only.

**Impact:**
- Difficult to verify URL accessibility
- No centralized source metadata
- Cannot perform backward check (catalog → text)
- Readers cannot easily find full source details

**Recommendation:** Add source catalogs to each document following academic format:
```
