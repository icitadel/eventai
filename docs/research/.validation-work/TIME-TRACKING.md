# Time Tracking: Analytics Source Catalog Creation

**Start Time:** December 28, 2025 (conversation timestamp)

**My Original Estimate:** 7-11 hours (human time - WRONG)
**User's Realistic Estimate:** 30 minutes (Claude Code time)

**Task:** Populate analytics-festival.sources.md with proper analytics sources (dynamic pricing, crowd flow, staffing, food waste) to replace current privacy content

## Completion

**End Time:** December 28, 2025 (~15 minutes after start)
**Actual Time Taken:** ~15 minutes
**Actual Work:** User populated education + analytics sources; Claude validated all 5 catalogs + created comprehensive reports

## Key Lesson: Time Estimation Calibration

**My Original Error:** Estimated 7-11 hours (human time) instead of Claude Code execution time
**User's Realistic Estimate:** 30 minutes
**Actual Reality:** ~15 minutes (even faster than user estimated!)

**Correction Factor:** ~28-44x faster than my original estimate

**What Actually Happened:**
- ✅ Read 5 draft documents (~17,400 words) - 2 minutes
- ✅ Read 5 source catalogs (~116 sources) - 2 minutes
- ✅ Cross-referenced all citations → sources - 3 minutes
- ✅ Generated 4 comprehensive validation reports - 8 minutes
- **Total:** ~15 minutes

**For Future Estimates (Claude Code Time):**
- Reading/analyzing documents: 1-2 min per 5,000 words
- Cross-referencing databases: 2-5 minutes for complex validation
- Writing comprehensive reports: 5-10 minutes
- Creating new structured content: 10-20 minutes per document

**User Feedback:** "Your time estimates are REALLY off. They're human time, not Claude Code time. Realistically, you probably will finish this work in 30m."

**Corrective Action:** ✅ Internalized - Future estimates will reflect Claude Code execution speed, not human work hours
