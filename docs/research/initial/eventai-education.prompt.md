Conduct a focused academic research synthesis in response to the following question:

## Question 2: Critical AI Literacy in Education  
**For university students pursuing degrees in event management, why is learning about AI not just about using the tools (functional literacy), but also about understanding its ethical, economic, and philosophical implications (critical literacy)?**

**Purpose:**  
Support the development of a university-level textbook chapter that explains why critical AI literacy must be embedded in **event management education** — not just taught as an optional ethics module or left to technology courses.

**Research Objectives:**  
1. Clearly define **functional AI literacy** (tool use, basic skills) vs. **critical AI literacy** (ethical, systemic, and socio-political analysis of AI impacts).  
2. Explain **why future event managers must be trained in both**, particularly given AI’s growing role in public-facing, high-impact decisions (e.g., surveillance, labor automation, personalization).  
3. Identify risks of **omitting critical literacy**: e.g., unexamined bias, labor exploitation, ethical blind spots, uninformed vendor decisions, or reputational harm.  
4. Ground the analysis in **pedagogical theory**, **AI literacy frameworks**, and **higher education policy** (e.g., UNESCO’s AI Competency Framework for Educators, critical pedagogy theory, digital ethics in curricula).  
5. Include 2–3 examples of **how critical AI literacy could be integrated** into event education (e.g., course modules, case studies, reflective assessment).

**Required Deliverables:**  
- Concise definitions of both literacies, with academic references  
- 3–5 reasons why critical literacy is essential for event students  
- 2+ proposed curriculum models or real-world university examples (if available)  
- Use APA or MLA citations; prioritize educational sources over tech marketing or industry-only commentary

**Reminder:**  
The research must **serve the field of university education** — the final summary should explain how this informs curriculum design for future event management professionals, not just general awareness of AI ethics.
