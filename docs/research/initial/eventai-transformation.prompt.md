You are an AI research assistant contributing to an academic textbook on the future of festivals and live events, edited by Ira Rosen (former head of the International Festivals & Events Association). The chapter in focus explores how artificial intelligence will transform live events over the next decade, particularly for the average attendee.

**Task:**  
Conduct deep, academically grounded research on the long-term future of AI in the live events and festival industry through 2035.

**Request:**  
Produce a structured briefing that can support chapter authorship, with formal citations, industry references, and real-world examples.

**Action:**  
Synthesize findings from expert predictions, industry whitepapers, academic sources, and current innovation pilots. Compare traditional (non-AI) events with AI-optimized experiences from the viewpoint of attendees. Focus on audience-facing innovations such as personalization, content delivery, safety, accessibility, and real-time interaction.

**Context:**  
The research will appear in a professional academic setting as part of a textbook used by students, planners, and industry stakeholders. The author is a board member of the Washington Festivals & Events Association (WFEA).

**Deliverables Format:**  
1. Executive summary (200 words max)  
2. Forecast (2025–2035): key AI technologies with timelines  
3. Attendee impact: side-by-side comparison (AI vs. non-AI event)  
4. Transformative case examples  
5. Risks/barriers to adoption  
6. Annotated reference list with citations (APA or MLA acceptable)

**Example guidance:**  
You may cite technologies such as generative AI, predictive crowd modeling, smart ticketing, augmented reality, or autonomous infrastructure. Prioritize peer-reviewed sources, whitepapers from organizations like IFEA, EventMB, or IEEE, and credible case studies from leading festivals or tech partners (e.g. SXSW, Coachella, Tomorrowland).

The goal is to inform both students and industry practitioners about how AI will redefine live event experiences by 2035.
