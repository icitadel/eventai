Conduct a deep, comparative research synthesis in response to the following question:

## Question 4: Surveillance Ethics and Privacy Risks  
**With the use of AI for real-time crowd movement analysis, facial recognition, and sentiment tracking, what are the primary ethical and data privacy risks festival organizers must address to use these tools for security and safety responsibly?**

**Research Objectives:**  
1. Identify the major categories of **ethical and privacy risks** involved in AI surveillance technologies used at festivals or large public events. Include:  
   - Consent and transparency  
   - Data retention and secondary use  
   - Misidentification and bias  
   - Function creep (expanded or unauthorized use)  
   - Psychological effects (e.g. chilling, discomfort)

2. Draw on documented cases, controversies, or lawsuits involving AI surveillance in live event or urban environments (e.g., facial recognition at music festivals, biometric crowd analytics at stadiums, AI police partnerships).

3. Reference **existing or emerging frameworks** for responsible use of surveillance AI:  
   - GDPR, CCPA  
   - UNESCO AI ethics  
   - EU AI Act  
   - Festival-specific ethical charters, if any

4. Discuss **trade-offs**: How do event organizers justify these tools for safety or logistics? Where have organizers successfully balanced security with civil liberties — or failed to?

5. Highlight **stakeholder perspectives**: attendees, organizers, vendors, regulators, and civil rights groups.

**Deliverables Format:**  
- 5–7 well-documented risks or concerns, with clear examples  
- At least 3 regulatory or policy sources  
- Short comparison: where is surveillance AI used responsibly, and where has it crossed ethical lines?  
- Use APA or MLA citations, including source links when available

**Context Reminder:**  
This is for an academic textbook chapter on AI in festivals and events. The audience includes future planners, students, and civic stakeholders — the analysis should inform **responsible design and policy guidance**, not just raise alarms.
