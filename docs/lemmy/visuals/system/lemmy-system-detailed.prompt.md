      - Example: Privacy narrative → Social thread (platform Content Knowledge)
  - Result: Multiplicative reusability
    - One Topic corpus supports N Voice narratives
    - Each narrative generates M Content outputs
    - Total outputs = 1 × N × M
    - Example: 1 Security corpus → 3 narratives → 5 formats = 15 outputs

**Reusability Pattern: Cascading Creation**
- One corpus supports many narratives
  - Research once, extract multiple stories
    - Single research investment enables multiple perspectives

    - Social thread: Twitter/X series on user rights
    - Video overview: Animated explanation of consent frameworks
    - Research paper: Academic analysis of consent effectiveness
- Efficiency gains compound
  - Quality research investment pays dividends
    - One research session → multiple narratives → many outputs
    - Time saved increases exponentially with reuse
    - Example: 10 hours research → 3 narratives (3h each) → 15 outputs (2h each)
      - Without reuse: 10h + 30h + 30h = 70 hours
      - With reuse: 10h + 9h + 30h = 49 hours (30% savings)
  - Narrative refinement benefits all outputs
    - Improve one narrative, all its outputs improve
    - Quality improvements cascade downstream
    - Consistent messaging across all formats
  - Format mastery improves consistency
    - Learn infographic best practices once, apply to all

  - Multiple poses show progression and process
- **Educational Icons (Unlimited, positioned meaningfully):**
  - **Books and Reading:** Open books for active learning, book stacks for corpus, closed books for references
  - **Light Bulbs:** Classic bulb shape for insights and "aha!" moments (rays emanating outward)
  - **Arrows and Flow:** Thick, hand-drawn arrows with slight wobble showing transformation and progression
  - **Collaborative Symbols:** Connected nodes for knowledge networks, hands together for partnership
  - **Learning Symbols:** Graduation caps, scrolls, certificates for knowledge acquisition
  - **Creative Symbols:** Paintbrushes, tools, gears for output creation
- **Mini-Scenes and Vignettes:**
  - Small illustrative scenarios showing concepts in action
  - Examples embedded as visual stories
  - Process flows with character annotations
  - Callout boxes with owl commentary

**Composition** (Multi-zone layout with layered depth):
- **White Space:** 30-35% (comprehensive but not cluttered)
- **Layout Zones:**
  - Top: Phase flow with detailed process boxes
  - Middle: Knowledge types as supporting layers
  - Bottom Left: Reusability pattern cascading diagram
  - Bottom Right: EventAI implementation example
- **Visual Hierarchy:**
  - Phase level (largest, bold color blocks)
  - Process level (medium, grouped elements)
  - Detail level (smallest, nested information)
  - Example level (callouts, annotations, mini-scenes)
- **Information Density:**
  - 5+ visual sections with clear grouping
  - Multi-level nested information
  - Annotations and examples throughout
  - Visual variety maintains engagement
- **Flow and Reading Path:**
  - Left-to-right primary flow
  - Top-to-bottom secondary flow
  - Arrows guide eye through transformations
  - Color coding reinforces phase distinctions

**Format**:
- **Dimensions:** 1280×720 webp, landscape (16:9 aspect ratio)
- **Orientation:** **CRITICAL - ALWAYS landscape** to accommodate horizontal flow and comparisons
- **Title:** No title on image (title in file metadata only)
- **Export:** High-quality WebP with optimized compression
- **Presentation Context:** Designed for slides, documents, web embedding

**Accessibility** (WCAG AA minimum):

  - Wise Owl Purple on Cream: 7.2:1 ✓
  - Electric Coral on Cream: 4.8:1 ✓
  - Soft Teal on Charcoal: 6.1:1 ✓
  - Sunshine Yellow on Charcoal: 8.9:1 ✓
- **Multi-Modal Communication:**
  - Icons paired with descriptive text labels
  - Color + shape + text for all meanings
  - Patterns/textures for data visualization
  - Never rely on color alone
- **Typography Accessibility:**
  - Readable font sizes throughout (12pt absolute minimum)
  - Generous spacing and clear hierarchy

## Structure

Top section shows horizontal flow of three phases with detailed process boxes. Each phase has nested detail showing specific tools and workflows. Middle section displays three knowledge types as layers with examples of how they're applied. Show interaction arrows between knowledge types and phases. Bottom left shows reusability pattern as cascading diagram: one corpus branching to multiple narratives, each branching to multiple outputs. Bottom right shows EventAI implementation as concrete example with specific artifacts. Use phase-specific color coding throughout. Include mini-examples and annotations to illustrate key concepts.
