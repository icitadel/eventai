# Lemmy System Architecture

Knowledge-to-output creation system showing how three phases work together with three knowledge types to enable reusable, high-quality content creation.

## Data Points

**Phase 1: Lemmy - Knowledge Corpus Building**
- Collaborative research using Deep Research and Verification chains
- Build verified, well-sourced Topic Knowledge corpus
- Foundation for all subsequent narratives and outputs

**Phase 2: Taley - Narrative Extraction**
- Extract multiple narratives from single corpus
- Apply Voice Knowledge for tone and style
- Shape information into compelling storylines

**Phase 3: Tooly - Output Creation**
- Transform narratives with format-specific best practices
- Create research papers, infographics, videos, social posts
- Leverage Content Knowledge for professional quality

**Three Knowledge Types:**
- Topic Knowledge - Deep subject matter understanding
- Voice Knowledge - Communication tone and style
- Content Knowledge - Format-specific best practices

**Reusability Pattern:**
- One corpus enables many narratives and outputs
- Adapt content without rebuilding research foundation

**Key Benefits:**
- Quality through phase-focused expertise
- Collaboration for better knowledge assembly
- Reliability from well-sourced foundation

## Style

**Aesthetic**: Schoolhouse Rock!-inspired educational design with owl characters and learning symbolism

**Color Palette** (3-5 colors - primary + secondary):
- Wise Owl Purple (#6B46C1) - Lemmy phase, owl character, wisdom elements
- Electric Coral (#FF6B6B) - Taley phase, narrative elements, storytelling warmth
- Soft Teal (#4ECDC4) - Tooly phase, output creation, finished products
- Sunshine Yellow (#FFE66D) - "Aha!" moments, insights, illumination
- Sage Green (#95E1A3) - Growth, learning progression, connections
- Cream background (#F7F7F2) - warm, inviting base
- Charcoal text (#3A3A3A) - readable, friendly contrast

**Visual Style**:
- Hand-drawn quality with bold outlines (3-5pt stroke)
- Flat colors with subtle depth (minimal gradients)
- Comic book art aesthetic with dynamic angles
- Playful but professional educational tone
- Geometric shapes with organic, friendly curves
- Peter Max-inspired psychedelic warmth

**Typography** (Standard tier - brief descriptors):
- Headings: 20-28pt bold, playful sans-serif (Cooper Black or Museo Slab style)
- Body text: 16-18pt, friendly sans-serif (Avenir Next or Nunito)
- Labels/annotations: 14pt minimum
- Maximum 3 font families
- Generous line spacing (1.5× minimum)
- High contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA)

**Owl & Learning Motifs** (moderate usage):
- 2-4 expressive owl characters with personality
  - "Lemmy" owl with magnifying glass (corpus builder)
  - "Taley" bird/owl with quill pen (storyteller)
  - "Tooly" bird/owl with tools (creator)
- Owls guide eye flow through phases
- Character expressions show phase activities
- 3-5 educational icons positioned meaningfully
  - Open books for knowledge building
  - Light bulbs for insights
  - Connected nodes for knowledge networks
  - Arrows showing flow and transformation
- Hand-drawn arrow style with slight wobble

**Composition**:
- White space: 35-40% (balanced information density)
- Left-to-right reading flow with clear progression
- 3-5 grouped visual sections
- Moderate visual hierarchy (phase → process → detail)
- Color-coded phase distinction
- Layered knowledge types supporting phases

**Format**:
- 1280×720 webp, landscape (16:9 aspect ratio)
- No title on image
- **CRITICAL:** ALWAYS landscape orientation
- Horizontal layout supports left-to-right comparisons

**Accessibility**:
- Color contrast minimum 4.5:1 (WCAG AA)
- Icons paired with descriptive text labels
- Multiple visual cues (color + shape + text)
- Readable font sizes throughout
- Never rely on color alone for meaning

## Structure

Top section shows horizontal flow of three phases with key processes in each. Middle section displays three knowledge types as layers supporting the phases. Bottom section shows reusability pattern with branching arrows from corpus to narratives to outputs. Use color coding to distinguish phases.
