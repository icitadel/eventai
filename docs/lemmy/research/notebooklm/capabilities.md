## Platform Strengths Summary

### What NotebookLM Does Best
1. **Multi-format Content Generation**: One research source → multiple output formats
2. **Rich Media Creation**: Audio, video, visuals without specialized tools
3. **Source-Grounded Content**: Always tied to your materials, not generic AI
