## Visual Elements

### Icon Style

**Approach**: Outlined (not filled) icons with rounded corners

**Characteristics**:
- **Line weight**: 2-3px stroke
- **Corners**: Slightly rounded (2-4px radius)
- **Style**: Modern, minimal, geometric
- **Color**: Single color per icon (no gradients)
- **Size**: Consistent within each infographic (typically 48-64px)

**Festival-Relevant Icon Set**:
- **Stage/Venue**: Simple stage outline with minimal detail
- **Crowd**: Stylized group of 3-5 people silhouettes
- **Ticket**: Simplified ticket shape with perforated edge
- **Music**: Minimalist musical note or waveform
- **Security**: Shield outline or camera icon
- **Data/Analytics**: Simple bar chart or graph icon
- **Calendar/Schedule**: Calendar grid outline
- **Location**: Pin or map marker

**Where to use icons**:
- Section headers (left of title)
- Process step indicators
- Category markers in comparison charts
- Quick visual scanning aids

**What to avoid**:
- Overly detailed/realistic icons
- Clip art style
- Generic business icons (briefcases, handshakes)
- Inconsistent styles within same visual

### Illustration Style (for Nano Banana)

**Approach**: Semi-flat illustration with subtle depth

**Characteristics**:
- **Dimensionality**: Flat design with subtle shadows (not 3D)
- **Complexity**: Simplified forms, essential details only
- **Line work**: Clean outlines (2-3px) with rounded corners
- **Shading**: Single directional light source, subtle gradients allowed
- **Perspective**: Slight isometric or front-facing (not extreme angles)

**Festival Context Applications**:
- **Crowd scenes**: Simplified silhouettes with variation in pose/size for depth
- **Venue layouts**: Clean architectural lines, aerial/isometric view
- **Technology elements**: Stylized devices, screens, interfaces
- **Data representations**: Creative metaphors (e.g., AI as conductor, data as streams)

**Mood**:
- Optimistic but not overly cheerful
- Energetic but not chaotic
- Professional but not sterile
- Distinctive but not weird

**Example prompt elements for Nano Banana**:
```
Modern semi-flat illustration style, clean outlines with rounded corners,
subtle depth through single-source shading, simplified festival context,
professional yet energetic mood, color palette using deep purple (#6B46C1),
electric coral (#FF6B6B), and sky blue (#4299E1) accents
```

### Diagram Style

**Approach**: Clean, functional diagrams with minimal decoration

**Characteristics**:
- **Shapes**: Rectangles with rounded corners (8-12px radius), circles, arrows
- **Lines**: 2-3px stroke weight, rounded caps
- **Arrows**: Simple triangular heads, consistent size
- **Connections**: Right-angle or curved connectors (no diagonal spaghetti)
- **Hierarchy**: Size and color to indicate importance

**Diagram Types**:
1. **Flowcharts**: Vertical or horizontal flow, clear decision points
2. **Process diagrams**: Left-to-right progression with numbered steps
3. **System diagrams**: Input → Processing → Output structure
4. **Comparison matrices**: Clean grids with visual separation
5. **Timelines**: Horizontal with phase markers

**What makes it "EventAI"**:
- Use festival-relevant shapes (ticket shapes, stage outlines, wristband icons)
- Color-code by meaning (purple = AI elements, coral = human elements, blue = data)
- Include small illustrative details (tiny crowd icons, musical notes) sparingly

---

## Layout Standards

### Grid System

**Base Grid**: 12-column grid with gutters

**Margins**:
- **Infographics**: 48-64px all sides (generous breathing room)
- **Diagrams**: 32-48px all sides
- **Slide decks**: 64-80px all sides

**Spacing**:
- **Between sections**: 48-64px vertical space
- **Between elements**: 24-32px
- **Between related items**: 12-16px
- **Text line height**: 1.5-1.6 (relaxed, readable)

### Alignment

**Primary rule**: Everything aligns to something

- **Text**: Left-aligned (easier to scan than centered)
- **Numbers**: Right-aligned in columns
- **Graphics**: Centered within their container or aligned to text
- **Headers**: Left-aligned with body content

### Visual Hierarchy

**Size hierarchy**:
1. **Hero statistic**: 48-72pt (one per infographic max)
2. **Section headers**: 24-32pt
3. **Body text**: 14-16pt
4. **Supporting details**: 12-14pt
5. **Fine print**: 10-12pt (captions, sources)

**Color hierarchy**:
1. **Primary focus**: Deep Festival Purple or Electric Coral
2. **Secondary elements**: Sky Blue, Warm Sunlight
3. **Tertiary details**: Mid Gray
4. **Text**: Midnight Slate (body), Mid Gray (supporting)

### White Space (Critical!)

**Tufte's Data-Ink Ratio Applied**:
- Every pixel should serve the information or serve clarity
- White space is not "empty" - it's active negative space guiding the eye
- More white space = higher perceived quality

**Requirements**:
- **Minimum 30% white space** in any infographic
- Resist urge to fill every gap
- Use white space to group related elements (proximity principle)
- Let important numbers breathe (isolated in white space)

## Professional + Whimsy: Specific Applications

### What "Professional" Means

✅ **Do**:
- Clean, structured layouts following grid
- Evidence-based content with sources cited
- Consistent typography and color usage
- High-quality data visualization
- Appropriate tone for business audience
- Print-ready quality (300-600 DPI)

❌ **Don't**:
- Generic stock photos
- Corporate clichés (handshakes, suited people at conference tables)
- Sterile, lifeless design
- Overly serious tone that intimidates

### What "Whimsy" Means

✅ **Do**:
- Unexpected color combinations (purple + coral)
- Playful icons and metaphors (AI as festival conductor)
- Slightly quirky visual analogies
- Energetic compositions (not rigid grids only)
- Festival-specific visual language (stages, crowds, wristbands)
- Personality in voice (headings can be creative)

❌ **Don't**:
- Cartoon characters or mascots
- Childish illustrations
- Jokes that undermine credibility
- So much personality that professionalism suffers

### The Balance in Practice

**Headers**:
- ✅ "The 42% Zero-ROI Problem" (data-driven + memorable phrasing)
- ❌ "Uh-Oh! AI Didn't Work!" (too casual)
- ❌ "Return on Investment Failure Analysis" (too dry)

**Visual Metaphors**:
- ✅ AI as orchestra conductor coordinating festival elements (apt, memorable)
- ✅ Data streams flowing into decision engine (clear, dynamic)
- ❌ AI as robot overlord controlling humans (cliché, negative)
- ❌ Generic gears and cogs (overused, meaningless)

**Color Usage**:
- ✅ Electric coral for critical statistic "42% zero ROI" (appropriate urgency)
- ✅ Deep purple for "AI-powered" labels (brand consistency)
- ❌ Rainbow spectrum just for decoration (purposeless)
- ❌ All black and gray (too serious, unmemorable)

**Layout**:
- ✅ Slightly rotated text box for key insight (visual interest)
- ✅ Curved connector between timeline phases (organic flow)
- ❌ Comic book style jagged speech bubbles (too casual)
- ❌ Perfect rectangles only, aligned to rigid grid (too sterile)

---

## Minimal Cruft Principle

**Cruft = Any element that doesn't serve the information or clarity**

### What to Eliminate

❌ **Decorative borders**: If it's just a line around the whole graphic, remove it
❌ **Unnecessary gradients**: Flat color is cleaner; gradients only for subtle depth
❌ **Ornamental shapes**: Circles, stars, bursts that don't mean anything
❌ **Excessive drop shadows**: Subtle shadows for depth only, not heavy 3D effects
❌ **Texture overlays**: Paper texture, fabric, grunge - none needed
❌ **Generic background patterns**: Dots, lines, grids that don't represent data
❌ **Stock photo backgrounds**: Blurred concert photos behind text (illegible)
❌ **Overuse of icons**: Every single bullet point doesn't need an icon

### What to Keep (Essential Elements Only)

✅ **Grid lines**: If they help read data in charts
✅ **Subtle shadows**: To distinguish overlapping elements (2-4px, 10-20% opacity)
✅ **Color blocks**: To group related information
✅ **Purposeful icons**: At section headers or as data markers
✅ **Borders**: Only between distinct sections (1-2px, neutral gray)
✅ **White space**: Generous margins and spacing (this is essential, not cruft!)

### The 5-Second Test

Show the infographic to someone for 5 seconds. They should grasp:
1. What this is about (title + visual scan)
2. The main point (hero statistic or key finding)
3. The structure (how information is organized)

If decorative elements draw attention away from these, they're cruft - remove them.

## Festival Context Integration

### Visual Vocabulary

**Use festival-specific elements to create immediate context**:

**Festival Environments**:
- Outdoor venues (stages, fields, tents)
- Crowd formations (not generic business people)
- Sound and light equipment
- Festival infrastructure (wristbands, entry gates, food vendors)

**Festival Actions**:
- Dancing/movement
- Artist performances
- Social interactions
- Navigation and wayfinding
- Transactions (tickets, merch, food)

**Festival Technology**:
- Mobile apps and phones
- RFID wristbands
- Screens and displays
- Cameras and sensors
- Sound systems

### Avoid Generic Tech Imagery

❌ **Don't use**:
- Generic "AI brain" illustrations
- Circuit boards or chips
- Robots or androids (unless specific to content)
- Abstract digital networks (unless showing actual data flow)
- Generic office workers or business meetings

✅ **Do use**:
- AI concepts illustrated through festival scenarios
- Technology integrated into festival environments
- Human festival-goers interacting with AI systems
- Actual festival case studies visualized

### Cultural Sensitivity

**Crowd representation**:
- Show diversity in illustrated crowds (varied skin tones, body types, ages)
- Avoid stereotypical festival-goer depictions
- Balance gender representation
- Include accessibility considerations (wheelchairs, sensory accommodations)

**Global awareness**:
- Festival examples from multiple continents
- Avoid US/Euro-centric assumptions
- Acknowledge cultural differences in privacy norms, festival culture
