## Style Philosophy

The Lemmy visual style embodies **collaborative knowledge building** through a warm, approachable, educational aesthetic. Like Schoolhouse Rock!, the style prioritizes **clarity over complexity**, **playfulness over formality**, and **memorability over decoration**.

### Core Characteristics

Inspired by the [1970s Schoolhouse Rock! animation aesthetic](https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/a-class-act-the-50th-anniversary-of-schoolhouse-rock/), the Lemmy style features:

- **Hand-drawn quality**: Organic, imperfect lines that feel approachable
- **Comic book art influence**: Bold outlines, flat colors, dynamic compositions
- **Peter Max-inspired palette**: Bright, bold, somewhat psychedelic colors with earthy tones
- **Educational optimism**: Warm, friendly, inviting visual language
- **Learning-focused symbolism**: Owls, books, light bulbs, and collaborative motifs

The [visual design reflects the 1970s era](https://www.encyclopedia.com/media/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/schoolhouse-rock) with vivid images supported by continuous repetition of key messages, mirroring how Lemmy builds knowledge through systematic iteration.

## Owl Motifs

[Owls symbolize wisdom, knowledge, and scholarly pursuits](https://www.quaggadesigns.com/post/unveiling-the-symbolic-meaning-of-owls-exploring-wisdom-and-mystery), tracing back to [Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom](https://greek.mythologyworldwide.com/the-significance-of-the-owl-athenas-symbol-of-wisdom-and-knowledge/). The owl's nocturnal nature and ability to see in the dark [metaphorically represent insight that transcends the ordinary](https://theowlslife.com/decoding-the-mystique-owl-symbolism-in-art-and-design/).

### Owl Character Design

**"Lemmy" the Owl** - Mascot for the knowledge-building system:

- **Style**: Simplified, geometric owl with Schoolhouse Rock! aesthetic
  - Large round head (2:1 ratio to body)
  - Big expressive eyes (1/3 of head size)
  - Small triangular beak
  - Rounded body, short wings
  - Minimal details (3-5 feather indications max)

- **Expressions**: Match density tier complexity
  - Concise: Simple dot eyes, slight curve beak (happy/neutral)
  - Standard: More detailed eyes (pupil + iris), beak variations
  - Detailed: Full expressions (eyebrows, cheek feathers, wing gestures)

- **Props by Phase**:
  - **Lemmy Phase**: Owl with magnifying glass, books, research notes
  - **Taley Phase**: Owl with quill pen, storytelling scroll, speech bubbles
  - **Tooly Phase**: Owl with tools, paintbrush, builder's blueprint

### Owl Integration by Density

**Concise Tier**:
- Owl as simple icon (silhouette or minimal detail)
- Used sparingly: 1-2 instances maximum
- Placement: Corner badge or section marker

**Standard Tier**:
- Owl with personality (expressive face, props)
- Used moderately: 2-4 instances
- Placement: Section headers, key concept markers

**Detailed Tier**:
- Owl as character (multiple poses, interactions)
- Used liberally: Throughout infographic
- Placement: Guides eye flow, annotates concepts, provides visual breaks

### Owl Symbolism in Context

Drawing from [visual design applications](https://www.design.com/maker/logo/wise-leaf-owl-131194/details), owls in Lemmy infographics should:
- **Illuminate darkness**: Position near complex concepts to signal "insight here"
- **Guardian of knowledge**: Frame important information or sources
- **Progressive learning**: Show owl "discovering" information left-to-right
- **Collaborative wisdom**: Multiple owls for collaborative research aspects

- Slight wobble for organic feel
- Use to show: Process flow, knowledge transfer, phase progression

**Collaborative Symbols**:
- Connected nodes/dots: Network of knowledge

## Visual Composition

### Schoolhouse Rock! Composition Principles

Inspired by the [1970s animation design](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Schoolhouse-Rock), Lemmy infographics follow:

1. **Bold Outlines**: 3-5pt black or dark charcoal strokes
2. **Flat Colors**: Minimal gradients (only for subtle depth)
3. **Dynamic Angles**: Slight tilt (5-15°) for energy
4. **Expressive Characters**: Exaggerated poses and gestures
5. **White Space**: Essential for breathing room (see tier requirements)

### Layout by Density

**Concise Tier** (40%+ white space):
- Central focal point (owl or main diagram)
- Radial or horizontal flow
- Maximum 3 visual sections
- High contrast between elements

**Standard Tier** (35-40% white space):
- Left-to-right reading flow
- 3-5 visual sections
- Grouped related concepts
- Moderate visual hierarchy

**Detailed Tier** (30-35% white space):
- Multi-zone layout (top, middle, bottom)
- 5+ visual sections
- Layered information depth
- Complex visual hierarchy

### Landscape Format (REQUIRED)

All Lemmy infographics MUST be **1280×720 landscape** (16:9 aspect ratio):

- Matches presentation format
- Horizontal flow supports left-to-right reading
- Accommodates comparisons (before/after, phase-to-phase)
