# The Accessible Prose Style Guide

Great writing connects, engages, and respects the reader's time. This guide synthesizes research from journalism, content design, and professional editing to define an accessible, friendly writing style that flows as narrative rather than fragmented formatting. The approach centers on five principles: write at a conversational level, cut ruthlessly, structure for flow, resist over-formatting, and bookend with clarity. Following these guidelines produces prose that holds attention while delivering substance efficiently.

## Write like you're talking to a smart friend

The foundation of accessible writing is voice—specifically, a voice that sounds like a knowledgeable person speaking directly to one reader, not lecturing a crowd. David Ogilvy captured this perfectly: "Don't address your readers as though they were gathered together in a stadium. When people read your copy, they are alone. Pretend you are writing to each of them."

Several concrete techniques create this conversational quality. **Use "you" and "we"** liberally—these pronouns transform abstract information into personal conversation. Write "When you travel abroad, don't forget your passport" rather than "When one travels abroad, one must carry a passport." **Use contractions** as you would in speech: "don't" instead of "do not," "it's" rather than "it is." This small change signals to readers that formality isn't a barrier between you and them. **Choose everyday words over their formal cousins**: "use" beats "utilize," "start" beats "commence," and "because" beats "due to the fact that." The classic test: if you wouldn't say a word at a dinner party, reconsider using it in your writing.

Readability research provides useful guardrails here. The average American adult reads at an **8th-grade level**, meaning material written above this becomes inaccessible to much of the population. Even highly educated audiences prefer simpler prose—Nielsen Norman Group recommends targeting 12th-grade level maximum for B2B content aimed at college-educated professionals. This isn't about dumbing down; it's about reducing friction. As the Federal Plain Language Guidelines note, "Plain language is not unprofessional writing or a method of 'dumbing down' to the reader."

The warmth-professionalism balance requires judgment. Conversational doesn't mean sloppy—maintain grammatical correctness while relaxing stiff conventions. You can start sentences with "And" or "But" for natural flow. You can write one-sentence paragraphs for emphasis. But errors undermine credibility. The goal is what The Economist describes as "conversational but authoritative; accessible yet comprehensive."

## Make every word earn its place

William Strunk Jr.'s foundational principle has guided writers for over a century: "Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts." This doesn't mean making everything short—it means making everything purposeful.

The practical application begins with cutting filler words. **"Very," "really," "actually," "basically,"** and **"literally"** almost never add meaning. The same goes for throat-clearing phrases: "It is interesting to note that" says nothing that deleting the phrase wouldn't improve. "In order to" is just "to." "Due to the fact that" is just "because." The editing process should hunt these constructions relentlessly.

Active voice produces naturally shorter, more direct sentences. "The ball was thrown by John" becomes "John threw the ball"—seven words become four, and the meaning sharpens. Watch for nominalizations (noun forms of verbs) that bloat prose: "The investigation of the case was completed by Nancy" should become "Nancy investigated the case." Similarly, eliminate expletive constructions: "There are four rules that should be observed" tightens to "Observe four rules."

Stephen King's formula—**second draft equals first draft minus 10%**—provides a useful target. The goal isn't arbitrary cutting but what Barbara Oakley, bestselling author of *A Mind for Numbers*, describes: "Cut cut cut cut cut cut—as much as I can. I want my stuff lean and mean, with no wasted words." The "Kill Your Darlings" philosophy, articulated by Arthur Quiller-Couch, warns that passages you're most proud of often need cutting most: "Whenever you feel an impulse to perpetrate a piece of exceptionally fine writing, obey it—whole-heartedly—and delete it before sending your manuscript to press."

Sentence length matters for comprehension. American Press Institute research shows **100% comprehension at 8 words or fewer**, **90% at 14 words**, and declining comprehension beyond 25 words. But variety matters more than any single number. Gary Provost's famous demonstration makes this vivid: five-word sentences repeated become monotonous, droning. Mix short punchy sentences with longer ones that develop ideas fully, and the writing sings. The rhythm creates engagement that uniform sentence length cannot.

## Structure points as narrative, not inventory

The difference between forgettable and memorable informational writing often comes down to structure. Bullet points and numbered lists present information as inventory—items to be catalogued. Narrative structure presents information as a journey—ideas that build on each other, connect, and lead somewhere. When your content requires readers to understand how things relate, narrative wins.

Nielsen Norman Group's research confirms that **prose reveals relationships that bullets cannot**. Lists present items as equal and disconnected. Prose shows causation ("Because X, Y followed"), demonstrates progression ("This led to..."), and creates momentum that pulls readers forward. For persuasive writing especially, "Persuasive writing is storytelling"—you need to lead readers through your argument, not present conclusions as disconnected assertions.

The practical technique for flowing narrative involves three elements. **First, use topic sentences** that clearly state each paragraph's controlling idea, giving readers cognitive anchors. **Second, employ transitions** that signal relationships between ideas—"however" for contrast, "therefore" for cause-effect, "similarly" for comparison, "building on this" for extension. These aren't decorative; they're the connective tissue that transforms isolated points into coherent argument. **Third, maintain back-references** like "This approach," "These findings," or repeated key terms that explicitly link new material to what came before.

Converting list-like content to prose requires embedding structure within sentences. Instead of three bullet points, write: "Three factors drive this outcome. First, [Point A], which establishes the foundation. Building on this, [Point B] extends the principle further. Finally, [Point C] completes the picture by..." The information remains organized; the presentation becomes narrative.

The inverted pyramid structure from journalism provides useful scaffolding. Place the most important information first, followed by supporting details in decreasing order of importance. This approach frontloads value—readers who stop at any point still capture the essential message—while creating natural flow from big picture to supporting detail.

## Reserve formatting for where it genuinely helps

The temptation to format everything as bullets stems from a reasonable observation: people scan rather than read word-by-word. Nielsen Norman Group famously found that **users read only 28% of words** on average web pages. But the solution isn't converting all prose to lists—it's writing prose worth scanning.

Bullets genuinely help when content is naturally list-like: features, specifications, steps in a process, quick-reference items. They reduce cognitive load by giving each item a distinct position and visual marker. They support scanning behavior effectively when each item is truly parallel and independent.

Bullets hurt when overused or misapplied. **Too many successive bullet lists fragment attention**—readers lose the thread connecting ideas. Bullets containing paragraph-length content still create "walls of text" that defeat the purpose of formatting. And bullets cannot show how ideas connect, build, or depend on each other. When everything is emphasized through formatting, nothing stands out.

The decision rule is purpose-driven. **Use bullets for**: factual summaries, highlights and features, process steps, quick-reference information. **Use prose for**: persuasive writing, explanations of how and why, arguments that build on each other, content where context and interconnection matter. A hybrid approach often works best: prose introduction providing context, selective bullets for genuinely scannable items, then prose again for analysis and implications.

Beyond bullets, other formatting serves specific purposes. Bold **1-3 critical terms or figures per section** to create scanning anchors without overwhelming. Use subheadings as signposts that tell readers what each section contains—headers should be informative enough that someone reading only headers grasps the overall message. Short paragraphs create visual breathing room and make content feel more approachable. But every formatting choice should answer the question: does this help readers understand and engage, or am I formatting out of habit?

## Cite sources at document end, not section end

Credibility requires transparent sourcing, but source placement affects readability. **Place all sources in a single list at the bottom of the document** rather than scattering them throughout sections. This approach respects narrative flow—readers shouldn't trip over citations mid-journey—while maintaining full transparency for those who want to verify claims.

The practical format is simple and clickable:

```markdown
**Sources:**
- [Descriptive Title](https://url.com) (optional context)
- [Study Name - Organization](https://url.com) (key finding noted)
- [Report Title](https://url.com) | [Secondary Source](https://url.com)
```

**Benefits of bottom-of-document sourcing:**
- Maintains narrative momentum without interruption
- Readers who want sources know exactly where to find them (one predictable location)
- Easier to verify comprehensive sourcing (all citations visible at once)
- Reduces visual clutter in the main text

**How to handle in-text attribution**: When citing specific claims, use natural attribution in prose ("According to McKinsey's 2025 State of AI report...") but save the URL reference for the source list. This balances immediate credibility with uninterrupted flow.

Avoid fragmenting sources across section boundaries. A reader seeking to verify claims shouldn't have to hunt through multiple source blocks. Consolidation serves both verification and reading experience.

## Open with the point, close with meaning

Strong writing is bookended—the opening establishes what readers will gain, and the closing delivers the significance of what they've learned. Both require craft.

The **BLUF approach** (Bottom Line Up Front, from military communication) provides the opening framework: state your conclusion or key message first, then provide supporting context. This respects reader time and creates immediate engagement by answering the question "why should I keep reading?" Before-and-after comparison illustrates the difference. A non-BLUF opening: "As we approach the end of the fiscal year, we should start focusing on ways to optimize our quarterly expenses..." A BLUF version: "Starting next month, we're switching to a new supplier to save $15,000 annually. This decision follows analysis of our quarterly expenses..."

Journalism's lede (opening paragraph) techniques add further tools. Strong ledes are **short—25 to 40 words maximum**—and address the essential who, what, when, where, why, and how. They use active voice for energy, get to the point without unnecessary throat-clearing, and make every word earn its place. Avoid "duh" ledes that state the obvious ("The meeting was held yesterday...") and question ledes that quiz rather than inform.

For more creative openings, copywriting provides proven hooks: **personal address** that speaks directly to the reader's situation, **surprising statistics** that create immediate interest, **thought-provoking questions** readers want answered, **brief anecdotes** that illustrate the topic's human dimension, or **contrarian statements** that challenge assumptions. The hook's job is simple: make readers want the next sentence.

Closings require different craft than openings. **Summaries condense**; **conclusions synthesize**. The distinction matters: a summary restates key facts objectively, while a conclusion draws meaning from those facts and points toward implications. Effective closings answer the "so what?" question—why should anybody care about what you've just explained? They connect specific content to broader significance.

Avoid repetitiveness in closings by rephrasing key ideas rather than repeating them, using fresh language rather than exact formulations from the introduction, and adding broader context you haven't yet explored. The phrases "in conclusion" and "in summary" signal lazy endings—if your closing is doing its job, readers don't need to be told it's a conclusion.

**Bookending**—echoing the opening in the closing—creates particularly satisfying structure. This might mean returning to an opening image with evolved understanding, answering a question posed at the start, completing a story begun in the introduction, or using parallel language with subtle shifts that reflect what the content has established. The key is that while the ending echoes the beginning, it doesn't duplicate it. The reader has traveled somewhere; the closing should acknowledge that journey.

## Putting the principles into practice

This style—accessible, brief, narrative, deliberately formatted, clearly bookended—serves readers by respecting their time and intelligence. Every technique traces back to the same commitment: communication that connects rather than impresses, that clarifies rather than complicates, that delivers value efficiently.

The practical application happens through deliberate editing. After drafting, read aloud to catch awkward phrasing. Hunt for filler words, passive constructions, and nominalizations. Check that each paragraph has a clear topic sentence and that transitions signal relationships between ideas. Question every bullet point—does this need to be a list, or would prose serve better? Verify that the opening delivers the point and the closing delivers meaning.

The test of success is simple: can a reader spend minimal time and walk away with maximum understanding? When writing achieves that, it has fulfilled its purpose. Everything in this guide points toward that outcome: friendly voice that removes barriers, brevity that respects attention, structure that reveals connection, formatting that helps rather than overwhelms, and bookending that delivers both hook and significance. These aren't rules to follow mechanically but principles to internalize—the craft of writing that earns the privilege of being read.
