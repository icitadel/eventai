# Infographic Evaluation Command

## Purpose

Comprehensively evaluate generated infographics (from NotebookLM, Nano Banana, or other tools) against EventAI style guidelines, infographic best practices, and source material accuracy to ensure professional quality, visual effectiveness, and factual correctness.

## Core Approach

You are a visual design critic and content verifier for academic/professional infographics. Analyze provided infographic files with extreme attention to:
1. **Style Adherence**: Compliance with EventAI Visual Identity Guide
2. **Best Practices**: Application of Tufte principles and professional infographic standards
3. **Data Accuracy**: Verification of all statistics and claims against source material
4. **Effectiveness**: Visual hierarchy, readability, and message clarity
5. **Density Tier Appropriateness**: Evaluate against intended information density tier

---

## Information Density Tiers

**CRITICAL: First identify which density tier the infographic targets, then evaluate appropriately.**

### The Three-Tier Framework

**1. Concise Tier** (Minimal Detail)
- Headlines + 3-5 key stats only
- 15-30 second comprehension
- 40%+ white space required
- **When to identify:** Extremely minimal text, no breakdowns, social media format

**2. Standard Tier** (Balanced Detail) **← DEFAULT ASSUMPTION**
- Key breakdowns with 3-4 components each
- 30-60 second comprehension
- 30% white space target
- **When to identify:** Most infographics fall here - balanced detail without overwhelming

**3. Detailed Tier** (Comprehensive)
- Explanatory annotations, case studies, multiple detail layers
- 2-3 minute close reading required
- 25%+ white space acceptable
- **When to identify:** Dense text, explanatory paragraphs, educational annotations

### Tier Identification Examples

**Standard tier indicators:**
- Stacked bars/charts show components with $ values but no explanatory text
- 3-4 bullet points per section (not paragraphs)
- Labels are brief (category name + value)
- Can understand main message in 30-60 seconds
- **Example:** Dynamic-pricing-2 (three sections, brief labels, readable breakdowns)

**Detailed tier indicators:**
- Each component has 2-3 sentences of explanation
- Year-by-year breakdowns or timelines with annotations
- Case study callout boxes with multiple statistics
- Requires close reading to absorb all information
- **Example:** Dynamic-pricing-1 and dynamic-pricing-3 (comprehensive text, educational annotations)

**Default assumption:** Unless evidence suggests otherwise, assume Standard tier

### Evaluation Criteria by Tier

**DO NOT penalize an infographic for:**
- ❌ "Too simple" if it's appropriately Concise tier
- ❌ "Too detailed" if it's appropriately Detailed tier

**DO penalize for:**
- ✅ Tier mismatch (e.g., claims to be Standard but has Detailed-level text density)
- ✅ Crossing tier boundaries inappropriately (Standard with occasional Detailed paragraphs = inconsistent)

**Scoring adjustments:**
- **Concise tier:** Penalize insufficient white space (<40%), penalize detail creep
- **Standard tier:** Penalize if too sparse OR too dense (target 30% white space, balanced detail)
- **Detailed tier:** Penalize if cognitive overload or accessibility fails (text too small, overwhelming)

---

## Required Context Files

### Primary References (Fixed Best Practices)

**1. EventAI Visual Identity Guide**
- Location: `docs/lemmy/style-guide/eventai-visual-identity.md`
- Purpose: Brand color palette, typography, layout standards
- Key elements: Deep purple (#6B46C1), electric coral (#FF6B6B), sky blue (#4299E1)

**2. Infographic Best Practices**
- Location: `docs/lemmy/research/infographics-best-practices.md`
- Purpose: Tufte principles, data-ink ratio, professional design standards
- Key elements: White space (30%+), minimal cruft, data integrity

**3. Source Material** (REQUIRED - will prompt if not provided)
- Location: Varies (e.g., `docs/writing/*/visuals/*/VIS-*.source.md`)
- Purpose: Verify data accuracy, ensure claims match authoritative sources
- Key elements: Statistics, percentages, dates, citations

### Optional Context (Can Override Defaults)

**4. Custom Evaluation Criteria**
- User can provide specific focus areas or override default best practices
- Example: "Prioritize print readability over web optimization"
- Example: "Evaluate for accessibility compliance (WCAG AAA)"

---

## Evaluation Process

### Phase 1: File Discovery & Context Gathering

**Step 1: Identify infographic files**
```bash
# User provides paths, or command searches for common patterns
/ig-evaluate docs/writing/1-transformation/visuals/eventai-timeline/*.webp

# If no paths provided, ask:
"Which infographic files should I evaluate? (Provide file paths or glob patterns)"
```

**Step 2: Identify presentation context (CRITICAL)**

**Determine if infographic is standalone or embedded:**

```markdown
## Context Identification

**File location analysis:**
- Path: docs/writing/2-education/visuals/academic-integration/academic-integration-3.webp
- Parent directory: `/writing/` (narrative content) ✅ Embedded context likely
- Visual directory: `/visuals/` (supporting narrative) ✅ Embedded context

**Prompt file analysis:**
- Check VIS-X.X-GENERATE-INSTRUCTIONS.md for use case
- Look for: "textbook", "curriculum", "figure", "embedded" → Embedded
- Look for: "social media", "standalone", "presentation" → Standalone

**Content location indicators:**
- In `/docs/writing/*/visuals/` → **Embedded** (supporting textbook/article)
- In `/docs/social/` or `/docs/marketing/` → **Standalone** (social/marketing use)
- Referenced as "Figure X.X" in narrative → **Embedded**

**Default for EventAI curriculum:**
Unless clearly indicated otherwise, visuals in `/docs/writing/*/visuals/` are **EMBEDDED**.

**Identified context: [STANDALONE | EMBEDDED]**

**Evaluation adjustments:**
- If EMBEDDED: ❌ DO NOT expect title on infographic (would be redundant)
- If EMBEDDED: ❌ DO NOT expect context statements (provided by narrative)
- If EMBEDDED: ✅ EXPECT minimal explanatory text (labels and data only)
- If STANDALONE: ✅ EXPECT title, context, self-contained design
```

**Context-Specific Evaluation Criteria:**

**EMBEDDED Infographics (Textbook, Articles, Curriculum):**
```markdown
✅ Expected elements:
- Data visualization (primary focus)
- Labels and values (what is shown)
- Legend if needed (understanding the visual)
- Source citation (can be minimal if in caption)
- Clean, focused design

❌ NOT expected (would be redundant):
- Title on the infographic itself (title is in figure caption or surrounding text)
- Context statements ("What this shows:", "Key takeaway:")
- Explanatory paragraphs (interpretation is in narrative)
- Self-contained design (relies on surrounding text)

⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT penalize embedded infographics for:
- "Missing title" (CORRECT to omit - title is in text/caption)
- "Needs more context" (CORRECT - context in narrative)
- "Too minimal" (CORRECT - should focus on data only)
```

**STANDALONE Infographics (Social, Presentations, Marketing):**
```markdown
✅ Expected elements:
- Clear title (part of visual design)
- Subtitle or context statement
- Complete labels and legends
- Source citations (visible on infographic)
- Self-contained design (understandable without external text)

❌ Penalize if missing:
- Title or clear main message
- Context (what is this about?)
- Self-contained explanation
```

**Step 3: Locate source material**
```
# Check for VIS-*.source.md in same directory
# If not found, ask:
"I couldn't locate source material for these infographics. Please provide:
 - Path to source document (VIS-*.source.md or similar)
 - Or confirm evaluation should proceed without data verification"
```

**Step 4: Load best practices**
```
# Automatically load:
- docs/lemmy/style-guide/eventai-visual-identity.md
- docs/lemmy/research/infographics-best-practices.md
- Apply context-aware evaluation (standalone vs. embedded)

# If user provides overrides:
"Using custom evaluation criteria: [list provided criteria]"
```

**Step 5: Validate Source Prompt (if available)**

**🔴 CRITICAL: Check prompt file for text pattern violations before evaluating infographic.**

```bash
# Locate prompt file
prompt_file=docs/writing/{topic}/visuals/{name}/{name}.prompt.md

# Run CLI validation
gemini-generate --validate-prompt $prompt_file --density {tier}
```

**Why this matters:**
- If the source prompt has text pattern violations (e.g., drilldown patterns in Concise tier), the infographic will inherit those issues
- Text pattern problems in the prompt → visual clutter on the infographic
- Validates prompt BEFORE judging infographic quality

**Prompt validation results feed into infographic evaluation:**

```markdown
## Prompt Validation Results

**File:** consent-spectrum.prompt.md
**Declared tier:** Concise

**CLI Validation:**
- Structural metrics: ✅ PASS (16 concepts, 2 depth)
- Text patterns: ❌ FAIL (12 drilldown violations)

**Text Pattern Issues:**
- ❌ Drilldown pattern: "Mandatory facial recognition - no alternatives" (should be label only)
- ❌ Too many words: "Bundled consent - accept all or entry denied" (8 words, max 5 for Concise)

**Impact on Infographic:**
- Expect explanatory text on infographic (AI generated drilldown content)
- Likely reduced white space (text blocks added)
- May inflate tier (Concise prompt → Standard infographic)

**Recommendation:** Fix prompt text patterns first, then regenerate infographic
```

**If prompt validation fails:**
1. Document issues in evaluation report
2. Note that infographic inherited prompt problems
3. Recommend prompt revision + regeneration
4. Do NOT penalize infographic for prompt-sourced issues (separate concern)

## Usage Instructions

### CRITICAL: Context Identification Required ⚠️

**ALWAYS identify presentation context BEFORE evaluation:**

```bash
# Step 0: Determine context
# Check file location and intended use

EMBEDDED context indicators:
- Location: docs/writing/*/visuals/
- Use: Textbook, article, curriculum
- Referenced as: "Figure X.X" in narrative
- Expect: NO title on infographic (title in caption/text)

STANDALONE context indicators:
- Location: docs/social/, docs/marketing/
- Use: Social media, presentations, marketing
- Referenced as: Independent visual
- Expect: Title on infographic (self-contained)

# For EventAI curriculum: Default to EMBEDDED unless explicitly standalone
```

**Evaluation adjustment example:**
```bash
# EMBEDDED context (most EventAI curriculum visuals)
/ig-evaluate docs/writing/2-education/visuals/academic-integration/*.webp
→ Evaluates as embedded (NO title expected on infographic)
→ Title presence would be penalized (redundant with caption)

# STANDALONE context (social media, presentations)
/ig-evaluate docs/social/linkedin-posts/*.webp
→ Evaluates as standalone (title REQUIRED on infographic)
→ Missing title would be penalized
```

### CRITICAL: Image Format Requirements ⚠️

**Always convert PNG to webp before evaluation:**

```bash
# Step 1: Convert PNGs to 1080p webp (REQUIRED)
todd-image-convert docs/writing/*/visuals/*/*.png --resolution 1080p --output-format webp

# Step 2: Evaluate the webp files (not the PNGs)
/ig-evaluate docs/writing/*/visuals/*/*.webp
```

**Why webp, not PNG?**
- Consistent resolution (1080p standardized)
- Smaller file sizes for web use
- Better compression without quality loss
- Standard format for EventAI visual assets

**DO NOT evaluate PNG files directly** - always convert first.

### Basic Evaluation (Single Infographic)

```bash
# Evaluate a single infographic with auto-detected source
/ig-evaluate docs/writing/1-transformation/visuals/eventai-timeline/transformation-infographic-adoption-timeline-3.webp

# Command will:
# 1. Read the webp file
# 2. Search for VIS-*.source.md in same directory
# 3. Load EventAI style guide and best practices
# 4. Generate comprehensive evaluation report
# 5. Write evaluation to [directory]/[name].eval.md
```

### Evaluation with Explicit Source Material

```bash
# Provide source material explicitly
/ig-evaluate docs/writing/1-transformation/visuals/eventai-timeline/transformation-infographic-adoption-timeline-3.webp --source=docs/writing/1-transformation/visuals/eventai-timeline/VIS-1.1-source.md

# Useful if source is in different location or has non-standard naming
```

### Comparative Evaluation (Multiple Variants)

```bash
# Evaluate multiple variants and compare
/ig-evaluate docs/writing/1-transformation/visuals/eventai-timeline/*.webp

# Command will:
# 1. Evaluate each variant individually
# 2. Create comparison matrix
# 3. Recommend best variant
# 4. Explain why winner was selected
# 5. Write comprehensive report to [name].eval.md
# 6. Update [name]-GENERATE-INSTRUCTIONS.md with learnings
```

### Custom Evaluation Criteria

```bash
# Override default criteria with specific focus
/ig-evaluate my-infographic.png --focus="accessibility,print-readiness"

# Or provide custom instructions
/ig-evaluate my-infographic.png --criteria="Prioritize color-blind accessibility (WCAG AAA), verify all text >14pt for classroom projection use"
```

### Evaluation Without Source Material

```bash
# Evaluate style and best practices only (skip data verification)
/ig-evaluate my-infographic.png --no-source

# Useful for:
# - Concept sketches before source material exists
# - Design-only review
# - Third-party infographics
```

## Common Evaluation Patterns

### Pattern 0: Context Misidentification (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Penalizing embedded infographic for missing title, or standalone for having one

**Detection:**
```
File: docs/writing/2-education/visuals/academic-integration/academic-integration-3.webp
Location: /writing/*/visuals/ → EMBEDDED context
Title on infographic: None
Evaluator flags: "Missing title" ❌ WRONG!
```

**Correct Evaluation:**
```
Context Identification: EMBEDDED (textbook visual)
Title presence: None (CORRECT ✅)
Rationale: Title is in figure caption/surrounding text. Having title on infographic would be redundant and break narrative flow.

Layout Score: 9/10 ✅
Strengths: 
- Correctly omits title (follows embedded context best practices)
- Clean, data-focused design
- Integrates seamlessly with narrative text

⚠️ CRITICAL: This is CORRECT design for embedded context. 
   DO NOT penalize for missing title - it SHOULD be absent.
```

**Wrong Evaluation:**
```
❌ "Missing title - needs clear heading" ← INCORRECT for embedded context
❌ "Needs context statement" ← INCORRECT - context is in narrative
❌ "Too minimal, needs more explanation" ← INCORRECT - narrative provides explanation
```

**Prevention:**
1. ALWAYS identify context (standalone vs. embedded) FIRST
2. Check file location (/writing/*/visuals/ = embedded)
3. Apply context-appropriate evaluation criteria
4. Document context identification in report

### Pattern 1: Color Palette Deviation

**Problem:** Infographic uses colors outside EventAI palette

**Detection:**
```
Expected: Deep purple (#6B46C1), electric coral (#FF6B6B), sky blue (#4299E1)
Found: Orange (#FF8C42), teal (#00CED1), generic gray
```

**Evaluation:**
```
Color Palette Score: 5/10 ⚠️
Issue: Non-brand colors used (orange instead of coral, teal instead of blue)
Impact: Reduces brand consistency, doesn't match EventAI visual identity
Recommendation: Regenerate with exact hex codes specified in prompt
Priority: 🟡 High (brand consistency important)
```

### Pattern 2: Insufficient White Space

**Problem:** Infographic appears cramped, visually cluttered

**Detection:**
```
Estimated white space: ~15-20% of composition
Minimum required: 30%
```

**Evaluation:**
```
White Space Score: 4/10 ⚠️
Issue: Insufficient breathing room, elements too close together
Impact: Reduces readability, appears cluttered, eye doesn't know where to focus
Recommendation: Increase margins, reduce number of elements, or enlarge canvas
Priority: 🟡 High (significantly impacts quality perception)
```

### Pattern 3: Data Accuracy Mismatch

**Problem:** Statistics in infographic don't match source material

**Detection:**
```
Infographic: "50% adoption by 2028"
Source material: "60-70% adoption by 2028"
```

**Evaluation:**
```
Data Accuracy Score: 6/10 ❌
Issue: Statistic outside source material range
Impact: CRITICAL - Factual error, misinforms audience
Recommendation: Correct to match source (use midpoint 65% or state as range)
Priority: 🔴 Critical (must fix before publication)
```

### Pattern 4: Typography Hierarchy Issues

**Problem:** No clear visual hierarchy, all text similar size

**Detection:**
```
Title: 28pt
Section headers: 24pt
Body text: 22pt
Statistics: 26pt
```

**Evaluation:**
```
Typography Score: 5/10 ⚠️
Issue: Insufficient size differentiation, no clear hierarchy
Impact: Reader doesn't know what to focus on, key stats not emphasized
Recommendation: Increase title to 36-40pt, stats to 56-72pt, reduce body to 14-16pt
Priority: 🟡 High (significantly impacts effectiveness)
```

## Quality Standards

### Evaluation is COMPLETE when:

✅ **Visual analysis performed:**
- EventAI style compliance scored (color, typography, layout, context)
- Best practices adherence verified (Tufte principles, white space, accessibility)
- Print/screen readiness assessed

✅ **Data verification performed:**
- All statistics extracted and inventoried
- Cross-referenced against source material
- Hallucinations/unsupported claims checked
- Numerical accuracy confirmed

✅ **Report generated AND WRITTEN TO FILE:**
- Executive summary with overall score and recommendation
- Detailed findings (strengths and weaknesses)
- Scorecards for each evaluation category
- Prioritized action items (critical/high/medium/low)
- **Report file created:** `[name].eval.md` in infographic directory

✅ **Comparative analysis (if multiple variants):**
- Each variant scored individually
- Comparison matrix created
- Winner identified with clear rationale

✅ **GENERATE-INSTRUCTIONS updated:**
- Prompt improvements added based on evaluation findings
- Common issues flagged with ⚠️ or ❌ in AVOID section
- Critical requirements emphasized at top of prompt
- Learnings fed back into generation workflow

### Evaluation is INCOMPLETE if:

❌ Source material not reviewed (unless explicitly skipped)
❌ EventAI style guide not consulted
❌ Best practices not applied
❌ Data accuracy not verified
❌ No clear recommendation provided
❌ Issues identified but not prioritized
❌ Scores assigned without explanation
❌ **Report not written to file** (only in conversation)
❌ **GENERATE-INSTRUCTIONS not updated** with learnings

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

❌ **Don't skip context identification:**
```
Bad: Evaluate all infographics as standalone, penalize embedded ones for "missing title"
Good: Identify context FIRST (standalone vs. embedded), apply appropriate criteria
```

**CRITICAL Example:**
```
❌ WRONG:
File: docs/writing/2-education/visuals/literacy-comparison/literacy-comparison-1.webp
Issue flagged: "Missing title - needs clear heading"
Problem: This is EMBEDDED context (textbook visual). Title SHOULD be absent!

✅ CORRECT:
File: docs/writing/2-education/visuals/literacy-comparison/literacy-comparison-1.webp
Context: EMBEDDED (textbook curriculum)
Title status: Correctly absent (title is in figure caption)
Evaluation: 9/10 - Proper embedded infographic design
```

❌ **Don't skip source material verification:**
```
Bad: "Looks good, numbers seem reasonable"
Good: Cross-reference every statistic against source document
```

❌ **Don't accept "close enough" on brand colors:**
```
Bad: "Orange is close to coral, good enough"
Good: Verify exact hex codes, flag deviations
```

❌ **Don't overlook accessibility:**
```
Bad: "Looks fine to me" (without checking contrast ratios or color-blind view)
Good: Test WCAG compliance, simulate color-blindness
```

❌ **Don't evaluate in isolation:**
```
Bad: Review infographic without context of intended use (print vs screen, audience, etc.)
Good: Consider use case, audience needs, distribution channel
```

❌ **Don't be vague in recommendations:**
```
Bad: "Could be better"
Good: "Increase milestone text from 12pt to 16pt for print readability"
```

## Final Notes

**Philosophy:** Visual quality and data accuracy are non-negotiable. Every infographic represents EventAI brand and academic credibility.

**Rigor over speed:** Thorough evaluation may take 15-30 minutes per infographic. This is time well spent to ensure professional quality.

**When in doubt, flag it:** If you cannot definitively verify a claim or assess a design choice, mark it for author review rather than making assumptions.

**Document everything:** The evaluation report should be detailed enough that anyone can understand your assessment and reproduce your findings.

**Balance:** Professional standards with practical constraints. Perfection is ideal, but "very good with minor improvements" is often publication-ready.
