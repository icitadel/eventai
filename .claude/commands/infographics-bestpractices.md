# Infographics Best Practices

## Purpose

Load comprehensive best practices for creating effective, information-dense, print-ready infographics into working memory to guide visual design, data visualization, and quality evaluation.

## Core Approach

This command doesn't perform actions—it loads authoritative, research-based visual design guidance into your working context. Use it when creating, evaluating, or refining infographics to ensure:
1. **Graphical Excellence:** Tufte's principles for information-dense yet clear visualization
2. **Professional + Whimsy Balance:** EventAI's distinctive credible-yet-memorable style
3. **Print Readiness:** 300-600 DPI, proper color profiles, technical specifications
4. **Minimal Cruft:** Every pixel serves the data, no unnecessary decoration
5. **Accessibility:** WCAG-compliant contrast, non-color-dependent information, inclusive design

---

## What Gets Loaded

When you invoke `/infographics-bestpractices`, the following knowledge areas become available in working memory:

### 1. Edward Tufte's Principles for Dense Information Display

**Tufte is the authority on data-rich visualization. His principles are essential for information-dense yet clear infographics.**

#### Graphical Excellence
- Well-designed presentation of interesting data
- Substance over style
- Many numbers in a small space
- Makes large datasets coherent
- Encourages eye to compare data
- Reveals data at multiple levels (overview → detail)
- **Tufte's ideal:** Graphic that rewards attention—viewer can scan quickly, then keep learning

#### Graphical Integrity
- Proportions in graphic = proportions in data
- Clear labeling (axes, scales, units)
- Show data variation, not design variation
- Number of information-carrying dimensions ≤ number of data dimensions
- Context matters (show baselines, comparisons)
- **Avoid:** Misleading scales, truncated axes, cherry-picked ranges

#### Data-Ink Ratio
**Formula:** Data-Ink Ratio = (Ink used for data) / (Total ink used)

**Maximize data ink, minimize everything else:**
- Remove unnecessary gridlines
- Eliminate decorative borders
- Simplify axis labels
- Remove redundant legends
- Every pixel should serve the data

**Caution:** Don't oversimplify to confusion—context elements (axes, labels) are necessary

#### Data Density
- As volume increases, data measures must shrink
- More data points → smaller dots (scatter plots)
- Busy time-series → thinner lines
- High-density displays require special care
- **High-performance graphics:** Maximum information in minimum space while remaining clear

#### Analytical Design
Charts should support serious analysis:
- **Comparisons:** Show relationships between variables
- **Multivariate thinking:** Display multiple dimensions simultaneously
- **Layered detail:** Overview + drill-down capability
- **Integration:** Text, numbers, and visuals work together

### 2. Print-Ready Technical Specifications

**Resolution requirements:**
- **Print (Paper/Posters):** 300-600 DPI minimum
  - High-quality prints: 600 DPI
  - Standard prints: 300 DPI
  - Export as high-resolution PDF or TIFF

**File format guidelines:**
- **Print:** PDF/X-4 or TIFF with CMYK color profile
- **Web:** PNG or WebP formats (sRGB color profile)
- **Both:** Export separate versions optimized for each medium

### 3. Core Design Principles

#### Typography (Two-Font Rule)
- **Font 1:** Title (can be distinctive, eye-catching)
- **Font 2:** Headings and body text (clean, simple, readable)

**✅ Do:**
- Keep body font simple and clean
- Ensure readability at small sizes
- Test legibility at print size

**❌ Don't:**
- Use decorative/script fonts for small text
- Mix more than 2-3 font families
- Use hard-to-read fonts for data/numbers

#### Layout and Flow
**Natural reading pattern:**
- Left-to-right, top-to-bottom (English)
- Information hierarchy matches reading flow
- Visual path guides the eye through content

**Composition hierarchy:**
1. Title/Main Message (immediate attention)
2. Key Statistics/Data (supporting evidence)
3. Detailed Information (for deep readers)
4. Citations/Sources (credibility footer)

#### White Space (Negative Space)
**Purpose:**
- Draw attention to key points
- Prevent visual clutter
- Create breathing room
- Establish hierarchy

**Critical principle:** White space is not wasted space—it's an active design element
- Use to separate distinct sections
- Don't fill every gap with content
- Strategic emptiness = visual power
- "Less is more" in information design

#### Focused and Purposeful Content
**Start with clear message:**
- What is the ONE main point?
- What should people remember?
- Is every element supporting that message?

**Content strategy:**
- Remove anything that doesn't serve core message
- Prioritize clarity over comprehensiveness
- One infographic = One focused topic
- Save secondary topics for separate visuals

### 4. Professional + Whimsy Balance (EventAI-Specific)

**How to achieve professional credibility + whimsical approachability:**

#### Whimsical Elements (Use Sparingly)
- Odd shapes and unexpected compositions
- Daring color schemes (bright accents)
- Playful illustrations or icons
- Personality-driven metaphors
- Soft, rounded typography for titles

#### Professional Elements (Foundation)
- Clean, structured layouts
- Sophisticated color palette (not childish)
- Readable, sans-serif body fonts
- Clear data visualization
- Proper alignment and spacing

#### The Balance Formula
- **Foundation:** Professional structure (80%)
- **Accent:** Whimsical personality touches (20%)
- **Result:** Memorable yet credible

#### Visual Approach Patterns

**Pattern 1: Soft Pastels + Crisp Lines**
- Playful pastel color scheme (approachability)
- Clean typography and uncluttered composition (professionalism)
- Result: Expressive character + aspiration

**Pattern 2: Bold Color + Minimalist Layout**
- Vibrant, daring colors (whimsy)
- Minimal elements, lots of white space (professionalism)
- Result: Eye-catching yet sophisticated

**Pattern 3: Quirky Icons + Serious Data**
- Illustrated, personality-rich icons (whimsy)
- Precise data visualization (professionalism)
- Result: Engaging yet trustworthy

#### Critical Success Factors
1. **Restraint:** Don't overdo whimsical elements (becomes unprofessional)
2. **Strategic placement:** Whimsy in accents, not foundational structure
3. **Clarity first:** Never sacrifice readability for personality
4. **Appropriate balance:** EventAI = professional audience, so lean toward credibility with whimsy accents

### 5. Minimal Cruft Principle (EventAI-Specific)

**What is "cruft"?**
- Decorative borders that serve no purpose
- Unnecessary gradients or shadows
- Generic stock imagery
- Excessive ornamentation
- Visual noise

**How to avoid:**
1. **Question every element:** "Does this help understanding?"
2. **Remove decoration:** If it's purely decorative, cut it
3. **Functional beauty:** Let data and structure create the aesthetic
4. **White space is good:** Don't fear emptiness

**Connection to Tufte:** Aligns perfectly with data-ink ratio principle

### 6. 2025 Design Trends

#### Dynamic Compositions
Traditional grid layouts → **Playful, dynamic compositions**
- Not rigidly structured
- Creative, flowing layouts
- Guide the eye naturally
- Organic, visual storytelling flows

#### Accessibility-First Design
**Critical trend in 2025:**
- Vision impairments (color blindness, low vision)
- Screen reader compatibility
- Alternative text descriptions
- High contrast ratios (WCAG standards)
- Non-color-dependent information (don't rely solely on color)

#### Interactive and Immersive Experiences
Infographics evolving beyond static visuals:
- Clickable elements
- Embedded videos
- Dynamic data visualizations
- Responsive to user interaction

**Note for EventAI:** While NotebookLM generates static infographics, consider this trend for digital versions

### 7. Ten Fundamental Visualization Principles

From scientific visualization research (applicable to all infographics):

1. **Know Your Audience:** Design for their expertise level
2. **Choose Appropriate Chart Types:** Match visualization to data type
3. **Simplify:** Remove non-essential elements
4. **Use Color Purposefully:** Color should convey information
5. **Label Clearly:** Everything should be immediately understandable
6. **Provide Context:** Show comparisons, baselines, benchmarks
7. **Tell a Story:** Visual should have beginning, middle, end
8. **Ensure Accessibility:** Work for color-blind, low-vision users
9. **Maintain Consistency:** Similar elements styled similarly
10. **Test and Iterate:** Show to real users, refine based on feedback

### 8. EventAI-Specific Applications

#### Distinctive Identity
**How to make EventAI infographics recognizable:**

1. **Consistent Color Palette** (defined in EventAI Visual Identity Guide):
   - Deep Festival Purple (#6B46C1)
   - Electric Coral (#FF6B6B)
   - Sky Blue (#4299E1)

## What This Command Doesn't Do

**This command is a reference loader, not an action executor:**

❌ **Doesn't automatically generate infographics**
- You must use `/ig-generate` or request specific prompt creation

❌ **Doesn't automatically edit image files**
- You must request design revisions or regeneration

❌ **Doesn't score infographics unprompted**
- You must invoke `/ig-evaluate` or request assessment

**Instead, it:**
✅ Loads authoritative best practices into Claude's working memory
✅ Makes Tufte's principles and design research immediately available
✅ Enables contextually-aware responses about infographic design
✅ Provides a shared framework for visual quality discussions
✅ Enhances `/ig-generate` prompts with research-based criteria
✅ Enriches `/ig-evaluate` scoring with Tufte standards

---

## Integration with EventAI Workflow

### Typical Workflow

```bash
# 1. Load best practices before infographic work
/infographics-bestpractices

# 2. Generate infographic with enhanced prompts
/ig-generate VIS-2.1
# → Automatically includes Tufte principles, EventAI palette, minimal cruft

# 3. NotebookLM generates 3 variants (manual step)
# → Download PNGs from NotebookLM

# 4. Convert to webp (required)
todd-image-convert docs/writing/2-education/visuals/academic-integration/*.png --resolution 1080p --output-format webp

# 5. Evaluate all variants
/ig-evaluate docs/writing/2-education/visuals/academic-integration/*.webp
# → Scores against Tufte, EventAI brand, accessibility (loaded standards)

# 6. Review evaluation report
# → Identifies winner, flags issues, prioritizes improvements

# 7. Regenerate if needed (score < 80%)
# → Refine prompt based on evaluation findings
# → Update VIS-X.X-GENERATE-INSTRUCTIONS.md with learnings

# 8. Publish winner (score 80%+)
# → Mark VIS-X.X complete in VISUAL-CONTENT-PLAN.md
```

### Beads Integration

```bash
# Create infographic task
bd create --title="Generate and evaluate VIS-2.1 infographics" --type=task --priority=2

# Load best practices (once per session)
/infographics-bestpractices

# Generate and evaluate
/ig-generate VIS-2.1
# (manual NotebookLM step, convert to webp)
/ig-evaluate docs/writing/2-education/visuals/academic-integration/*.webp

# Document results
bd update beads-xxx --status=completed --reason="Variant #3 selected, scored 87/100, meets Tufte standards and EventAI brand"
```

---

## Quality Standards

**Best practices are SUCCESSFULLY LOADED when:**

✅ Claude can reference Tufte's principles without re-reading research
✅ Responses demonstrate awareness of data-ink ratio (maximize data, minimize decoration)
✅ Recommendations align with EventAI palette (purple, coral, blue, white)
✅ White space targets are specific (30%+ composition)
✅ Professional + whimsy balance is articulated (80% credible, 20% playful)
✅ Minimal cruft principle is applied (question every decorative element)
✅ Accessibility checks cover contrast (4.5:1), color-independence, labeling

**Best practices are NOT loaded if:**

❌ Claude recommends decorative borders without questioning necessity (cruft)
❌ White space suggestions are vague ("add some space")
❌ Color palette deviations accepted without EventAI brand justification
❌ Tufte's principles not referenced in design evaluations
❌ Accessibility overlooked (color-only information, low contrast)
❌ Professional + whimsy balance undefined or inconsistently applied

## Final Philosophy

**Tufte's Wisdom:** "Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space."

**EventAI Application:** Information-dense, visually striking, professionally credible, whimsically memorable, ruthlessly efficient. Every pixel earns its place.

**Minimal Cruft Mantra:** If it doesn't help understanding, it hurts understanding. When in doubt, remove decoration.

**Professional + Whimsy Balance:** Foundation must be credible (clean structure, clear data, proper alignment). Personality comes from strategic accents (unexpected colors, playful icons, festival metaphors). Never sacrifice clarity for personality.

**Accessibility is Non-Negotiable:** 2025 design standards require contrast, labeling, and non-color-dependent information. Universal design benefits all viewers, not just those with identified disabilities.
