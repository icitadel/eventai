# Festival Biometric Consent Models

Comparison of three consent architectures for biometric systems at festivals.

## Consent Model 1: Coercive (Non-Compliant)

### Definition
Mandatory biometric enrollment with no alternatives

### Implementation
- Facial recognition required at all entry points
- No manual ID check option available
- Attendees who refuse cannot enter

### Legal Status
Violates GDPR Article 7 (freely given consent) and Article 9 (special category data)

## Consent Model 2: Soft Wall (Problematic)

### Definition
Default opt-in with nominal alternatives

### Implementation
- Biometric enrollment enabled by default
- Manual ID check requires 45-minute wait vs. 2-minute facial scan
- Opt-out hidden in account settings (3 menus deep)

### Legal Status
Gray area - technically provides choice, but choice not genuinely "free" under GDPR Article 7 interpretation

## Consent Model 3: Genuine Choice (Compliant)

### Definition
Explicit opt-in with equal alternatives

### Implementation
- Clear YES/NO choice at registration (equal prominence)
- Facial recognition: Instant entry (advertised benefit)
- RFID wristband: 3-minute entry (comparable speed)
- Manual ID: 5-minute entry (acceptable alternative)

### Legal Status
Compliant with GDPR Article 7 (freely given) and Article 9 (explicit consent for biometric data)
