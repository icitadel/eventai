# Refocus education section on core question (2,900 → 2,050 words, 3 → 1 infographic)

## Summary
Rewrote education.draft6.md to answer "why critical literacy matters" instead of exhaustively analyzing how the education gap developed. Archived 3 visual sets that supported detailed gap analysis but not the core question.

## Impact

**Features:**
- Tightened narrative focus: cut detailed university program descriptions, professional certification breakdowns, structural barrier explanations, vicious cycle dynamics
- Preserved critical content: opening vendor scenario, functional vs critical definitions, real consequences (GDPR fines, wrongful arrests, failed ROI), dual competency framework
- 850-word reduction (29% shorter) with clearer answer to core question

**Media Alignment:**
- Archived academic-integration, skills-gap-cycle, curriculum-structure visuals to archive/2025-12-31-draft6-revision/
- Retained literacy-comparison infographic (directly supports functional vs critical concept)
- Created draft6-media-assessment.md documenting visual decisions and rationale

**Process:**
- Established archive pattern for education visuals (following transformation model)
- Media now aligned with narrative scope: 1 infographic for focused 2,050-word section vs 3 for sprawling 2,900-word analysis
